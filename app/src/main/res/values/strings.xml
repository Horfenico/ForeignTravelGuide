            AFGHANISTAN - AVOID ALL TRAVEL

            Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development Canada advises against all travel to Afghanistan,

            warning, you are taking a serious risk. We strongly recommend that Canadians register
            with the Registration of Canadians Abroad (ROCA) service and include personal and
            professional contact details. If you are already in Afghanistan, you should leave. The
            Embassy of Canada in Afghanistan\'s ability to provide consular and other support
            throughout the country is very limited.

            coverage with your health insurance provider. Access to medical services may be scarce.
            Should you require medical evacuation, service availability is limited and can cost
            hundreds of thousands of dollars, and you would assume sole responsibility for any
            costs. The Government of Canada cannot guarantee access to medical evacuation services.

            economic tensions in the country. Clashes between young demonstrators and law
            enforcement authorities have been frequent, especially in Conakry, where incidents of

            Iran - AVOID ALL TRAVEL

            Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development Canada advises against all travel to to Iran. On
            September 7, 2012, Canada closed its embassy in Iran.

            Because of heightened regional tensions, Canadian travellers in Iran will be closely
            watched by Iranian authorities. Iranian irritation at the Embassy closure may heighten
            this scrutiny of Canadians. Seemingly innocuous behaviours, such as the use of cameras
            in public places, travel beyond well-established tourist attractions, or casual
            interactions with Iranian friends, may be misinterpreted and may lead to investigation
            and harassment. Canadian travellers may be arbitrarily questioned, arrested and detained
            for a long period.

            Canadians who choose to travel to Iran despite this warning should know that the
            Government of Canada’s ability to offer consular services in Iran is very limited and
            should expect delays if they request travel documents or a replacement for a lost or
            stolen passport. Ensure that your travel documents are up to date. Canadians in Iran
            seeking routine consular and passport services should contact the Embassy of Canada in
            Ankara, Turkey or any other Canadian mission. Canadians in Iran who require urgent
            assistance may contact the Emergency Watch and Response Centre in Ottawa at 613-996-8885
            (collect calls accepted), by email sos@international.gc.ca or by submitting an on-line
            form.

            Dual citizenship

            In the context of heightened regional tensions, Iranian-Canadian dual citizens may be
            particularly vulnerable to investigation and harassment by Iranian authorities.
            Canadians who have Iranian nationality are warned in particular that the Iranian regime
            does not recognize the principle of dual citizenship. By doing so, the Iranian regime
            makes it virtually impossible for Government of Canada officials to provide consular
            assistance to Iranian-Canadians in difficulty.

            situation throughout Iraq is very volatile, dangerous and unpredictable, and could

            If you choose to travel to Iraq despite this warning, ensure that you are accompanied by
            professional security escorts at all times and carefully review your security

            assistance in all parts of Iraq is severely limited. See Security for more information.

            Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development Canada advises against non-essential travel to
            Liberia due to the Ebola outbreak, resulting in lowered access to quality health care.

            There is no Government of Canada office in Liberia. Therefore, our ability to provide
            consular assistance is extremely limited. If you decide to remain in or travel to
            Liberia despite this Advisory, verify your coverage with your health insurance provider.
            Access to medical services may be scarce. Should you require medical evacuation, service
            availability is limited and can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars, and you would

            Libya - AVOID ALL TRAVEL

            Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development Canada advises against all travel to Libya due to
            persistent insecurity throughout the country, including sustained armed conflict, a high
            risk of terrorist attacks, an unpredictable political situation and a high crime rate.
            If you are presently in Libya, you should leave now by the safest means possible.

            The Government of Canada’s ability to provide consular services to Canadian citizens in
            Libya is extremely limited. The Embassy of Canada to Libya in Tripoli has suspended
            operations until further notice. Canadian officials have left the country. Canadians in
            Libya should contact the Embassy of Canada to Tunisia in Tunis or the Emergency Watch
            and Response Centre in Ottawa for emergency consular assistance. We strongly recommend
            that Canadians register with the Registration of Canadians Abroad (ROCA) service.

            Canadian citizens travelling to or remaining in Libya despite this advice should ensure
            that their travel documents are up to date, limit their movements and keep abreast of

            Syria - AVOID ALL TRAVEL

            Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development Canada advises against all travel to Syria due to
            ongoing conflict. Commercial means to leave Syria are extremely limited, and you should
            leave as soon as it is safe to do so. Since November 2011, DFATD has urged Canadians to
            leave Syria. Many airlines, including Arab League carriers, have suspended their flights
            from Syria. Battles between Syrian and opposition armed forces have taken place in the
            vicinity of the airports in Damascus and Aleppo, which could be closed quickly, with
            little or no notice, and checkpoints may delay or impede access to the airport. Contact
            your airline to check the status of your flight before travelling to the airport. We
            strongly recommend that Canadians register with the Registration of Canadians Abroad
            service.

            If you are leaving Syria by land to Lebanon, transit through the border area as quickly
            as possible, as we advise against all travel to the border region with Lebanon.

            If you choose to remain in Syria despite this warning, limit your movements and keep
            abreast of the latest developments. Outbreaks of violence can occur with little or no
            notice, and you risk being at the wrong place at the wrong time. Ensure your travel
            documents are up to date.

            Donetsk or Luhansk Oblasts and are unable to exit the region safely, remain indoors,
            maintain a low profile and avoid large crowds and demonstrations.

            See Security for more information.

            Regional Advisory for the Kharkiv Oblast

            Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development Canada (DFATD) advises against non-essential

            Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development Canada advises against non-essential travel to
            areas bordering the DRC, Angola and Mozambique. The possibility of border conflicts
            and/or the presence of refugees and armed combatants make these areas potentially
            dangerous and unstable. Carjacking and armed assaults also pose a risk. Landmines

            The currency is the afghani (AFN). The economy operates on a cash-only basis. Credit
            cards are not widely accepted. U.S. dollars are accepted but should be recent and in

            of both Canadian and Albanian authorities.
            Identification

            You must carry adequate identification at all times, such as a legible photocopy of your
            passport. To avoid the loss or theft of your identification documents, you should not
            carry your original passport, citizenship card or birth certificate with you, except
            when travelling from one city to another within Albania.
            Illegal drugs

            Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are strict. Convicted
            offenders can expect jail sentences and heavy fines.
            Illegal activities

            Do not photograph military installations or personnel without proper permission as it is
            illegal; charges may be laid or cameras may be confiscated.
            Marriages

            If a Canadian intends to marry an Albanian, the Albanian partner should provide the list
            of documentation required to get married in Albania and documents must be legalized by
            the Embassy of Albania in Ottawa. For further details, please contact the Consulate of
            Canada in Albania.
            Homosexual activities

            While homosexuality is not illegal in Albania, it is not widely accepted. Exercise
            discretion as Albanian society is very conservative.
            Driving laws

            An International Driving Permit (IDP) is required as a supplement to a valid driver\'s
            licence.

            Laws against drinking and driving are strictly enforced.

            The use of cellular phones while driving is prohibited.

            Police have taken drastic measures to decrease the number of accidents. Respect speed
            limits and the rules of the road in order to avoid heavy fines and the suspension of
            your driving licence.
            Money

            The currency of Albania is the lek (ALL). The euro is used as a benchmark for the
            currency.

            The economy is primarily cash-based. You should carry some cash, as traveller\'s cheques
            and credit cards are not widely accepted. International hotels in Tirana accept American
            Express, Visa, Diners Club and MasterCard. Automated banking machines are widely
            available.

            Traveller\'s cheques and eurocheques can be exchanged at the National Bank of Albania in
            Tirana. U.S. dollars and Swiss francs are also accepted.

            Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are strict. Convicted
            offenders can expect detention or other penalties.
            Dual citizenship

            Dual citizenship is not legally recognized, which may limit the ability of Canadian
            officials to provide consular services. You should travel using your Canadian passport
            and present yourself as Canadian to foreign authorities at all times. See Travelling as
            a dual citizen for more information.

            Under Algerian law, men under the age of 35 must complete their military service. There
            have been cases of Canadian citizens who also have Algerian citizenship being refused
            permission to leave the country because they did not possess a card exempting them from
            military service, a deferment card, or evidence that they have completed their military
            service. While the Embassy of Canada will attempt to help individuals in this situation,
            they are considered to be Algerian citizens by Algerian authorities.
            Dress and behaviour

            Islamic practices and beliefs are closely adhered to in the country\'s customs, laws and
            regulations. Dress conservatively, behave discreetly, and respect religious and social
            traditions to avoid offending local sensitivities. It would be prudent for women to
            cover their arms and legs and wear a headscarf.
            Money

            The currency is the Algerian dinar (DZD), which is non-convertible. Convert any excess
            currency prior to departure from Algeria. Cash is the preferred method of payment in
            Algeria. Traveller\'s cheques and credit cards are not accepted outside of major hotels
            and some business establishments such as airline companies. Automated banking machines
            (ABMs) are available in a few major hotels and banks, although they are often
            unreliable.

            Canadian and Andorran authorities.
            Illegal drugs

            Andorran authorities practise zero tolerance with respect to possession, use or
            trafficking of illegal drugs. Penalties are strict.
            Driving laws

            An International Driving Permit is recommended.

            Children under 10 years of age are not allowed to sit in the front passenger seat.

            The use of cellular telephones while driving is prohibited, unless they are fitted with
            a hands-free device.

            Vehicles must be equipped for emergency situations: two red warning triangles that you
            must place in front of and behind the vehicle in case of accident or breakdown; a
            reflective jacket that you must wear when leaving a vehicle that is stranded or involved
            in a highway accident; and a spare tire and full set of spare light bulbs, plus the
            tools to change them. Drivers who fail to comply with these laws may be subject to
            on-the-spot fines.

            Penalties for drinking and driving are strict. The legal blood alcohol limit is 0.05
            percent. Convicted offenders can expect heavy fines or jail, and driver\'s licences may
            be confiscated immediately.
            Customs

            Andorra is not a member of the European Union, and purchases of duty-free tobacco,
            liquor and luxury goods are subject to taxes and duties on re-entering European Union
            countries. France and Spain apply strict rules on the amount of tobacco imported from
            Andorra for personal use. Canadians should contact the Embassy of the Principality of
            Andorra in New York for specific information regarding customs requirements.
            Money

            The currency of Andorra is the euro (EUR).

            When crossing one of the external border control points of the European Union (EU), you
            must make a declaration to customs upon entry or exit if you have at least â‚¬10,000, or
            the equivalent in other currencies. The sum can be in cash, cheques, money orders,
            traveller\'s cheques or any other convertible assets. This does not apply if you are
            travelling within the EU or in transit to a non-EU country. For more information on the
            EU legislation and links to EU countries\' sites, visit the web page of the European
            Commission on cash controls.

        <item>Laws and illegal activities

            Involvement in black-market currency conversion could lead to arrest.

            Punishment for drug-related offences can be severe.

            The laws of Angola prohibit sexual acts between individuals of the same sex. LGBT
            travellers should carefully consider the risks of travelling to Angola. See Homosexual,
            bisexual and transgender travel for more information.

            Some handicrafts considered of cultural value may be retained by customs. It is illegal
            to remove turtle shells and ivory from the country.

            Avoid photographing airports, major roads, bridges, communications installations,
            military personnel and government buildings. Taking photos of urban areas may be frowned
            upon by police.

            An International Driving Permit is recommended.
            Dual citizenship

            Although dual nationality is legally recognized in Angola, Angolan nationality takes
            precedence according to local law. Holding dual nationality may limit the ability of
            Canadian officials to provide consular services. See Travelling as a dual citizen for
            more information.
            Money

            The currency in Angola is the kwanza (AOA). It is not convertible on the international
            market. Dollars can be converted into kwanzas, or vice versa, at the few exchange
            bureaus in Luanda or at local banks. Receiving foreign currency is often very difficult
            due to present scarcity (even for those with foreign currency accounts). Kwanzas cannot
            be taken out of the country. No more than US$15,000 can be taken into or out of Angola,
            unless an official declaration is made upon entry.

            Newer U.S.-dollar bills are favoured, due to the ease with which the older bills are
            counterfeited. Credit cards are accepted at only a few of Luanda\'s largest hotels and
            restaurants, and it varies as to which cards are accepted. VISA is the most commonly
            accepted credit card. Leave a copy of your card information with a trusted family member
            or friend in case of emergency.

            Traveller\'s cheques are difficult to cash in Angola; normally, they are accepted only
            at some of the best hotels.

            Automated banking machines dispense kwanzas only. Some ABMs in Luanda accept VISA cards,
            but only to withdraw kwanzas. Note that machines often malfunction or run out of cash.
            Debit cards do not work.

            Marriages

            If planning to marry in Anguilla, ensure that you meet all requirements and have all
            necessary documents before leaving Canada. Most countries require a certificate stating
            that there are no Canadian impediments to your marriage.

        <item>The Protocol to the Antarctic Treaty on Environmental Protection (Madrid Protocol),
            adopted in 1991 by the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties, designates Antarctica as a
            natural reserve, devoted to peace and science. Several areas have ecological,
            scientific, historical or other value and are afforded special protection. It is
            forbidden to bring any non-native species into Antarctica. This includes poultry, pet
            dogs, pet cats and household plants. It is also prohibited to take or harmfully
            interfere with Antarctic wildlife except in accordance with a permit issued by a
            national authority.

            The Madrid Protocol came into force in 1998 and was ratified by 30 countries. Under the
            Madrid Protocol, parties are required to regulate the activities of expeditions
            organized in or proceeding from their territory to the Antarctic, as well as the
            activities of their vessels, aircraft and Antarctic stations.

            Canada ratified the Madrid Protocol in December 2003, and developed the Antarctic
            Environmental Protection Act and its supporting regulation to implement the Protocol in
            Canada. In so doing, the Canadian government oversees the activities of its citizens in
            the Antarctic, and provides the means to address potential future environmental risks in
            the Antarctic.

            If planning to marry in Antigua and Barbuda, ensure that you meet all requirements
            before leaving Canada. Most countries require you to produce a certificate stating that
            there are no Canadian impediments to your marriage. You should arrange to obtain the
            certificate in Canada before your departure.
            Driving laws

            You must have a local driving permit to drive in Antigua and Barbuda. It can be obtained
            for EC$50 (approximately C$20) at any car rental agency or police station upon
            presentation of a valid Canadian driver\'s licence.

            The currency is the Argentine peso (ARS). The Government of Argentina has imposed
            restrictions on the purchase of foreign currency in Argentina. As a result, many
            businesses catering to tourists now accept U.S. dollars as a way to access foreign
            currency. Currency exchange restrictions are subject to daily changes. Monitor local
            news for update on these restrictions.

            Foreign credit and debit cards are accepted in main cities. When using credit cards,
            ensure that your card remains in view. You may be required to produce photo
            identification, such as a driver\'s licence or a photocopy of your passport, when paying
            with a credit card. Cash withdrawals from foreign bank accounts at ABMs are subject to

            Possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs may result in jail sentences and heavy
            fines.

            There is zero tolerance for drinking and driving.

            You may be fined for photographing military installations or government buildings. Seek
            permission from local authorities before taking photographs.

            The export of cultural items is regulated.
            Dual citizenship

            Dual citizenship is legally recognized in Armenia, but Armenian citizenship takes
            precedence. Canadian officials may, therefore, be limited in their ability to provide
            consular services to Canadian-Armenian citizens.

            Canadian-Armenian citizens may also be subject to national obligations, such as taxes
            and military service. Check your status with the Embassy of the Republic of Armenia in
            Canada. Dual nationals who try to avoid the compulsory military service may be detained
            for draft evasion and face hefty fines or imprisonment.

            See Travelling as a dual citizen for more information.
            Money

            The currency is the Armenian dram (AMD). The economy is primarily cash-based. U.S.
            dollars and credit cards are generally accepted when paying for hotel accommodation.
            There are no limitations on exchange of foreign currency. However, amounts exceeding
            US$10,000 must be declared at border crossings. Some banks may not accept a foreign bank
            card at automated banking machines, but you can make withdrawals at the counter with
            your passport as identification.

            Homosexuality is illegal, and is punishable by imprisonment and deportation.

            Common-law relationships are tolerated but not recognized.

            Avoid physical contact, for example, holding hands, in public.

            Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are strict and include the
            death penalty. Convicted offenders can expect lengthy jail sentences and/or heavy fines.
            The possession of drugs, even a very small amount, can result in arrest and, if
            convicted, a four-year minimum prison term.

            Alcohol is available for purchase by non-Muslims at special stores. Observe restrictions
            concerning the consumption of alcohol. Attitudes regarding alcohol are not favourable.

            There is a zero-tolerance policy regarding drinking and driving. Drinking while in

            pornography or seditious literature; and habit-forming or hallucinatory drugs.
            Legal process

            If you are involved in Bahraini court proceedings due to indebtedness, labour
            disagreement or other legal dispute, you may be prevented from leaving Bahrain until
            your case is resolved.
            Dress and behaviour

            The country\'s customs, laws and regulations adhere closely to Islamic practices and
            beliefs. Dress conservatively, behave discreetly and respect religious and social
            traditions to avoid offending local sensitivities. For example, women should cover their
            arms and legs, and men should not wear shorts in public.

            You may be subject to heavy fines if showing disrespect toward officials by making
            verbal insults and obscene gestures.
            Child custody

            Child custody decisions are based on Islamic law. It is extremely difficult for a
            Canadian woman, even if she is Muslim, to obtain custody of her children through a
            Bahraini court decision. Regardless of their parents\' marital status, minor children of
            a Bahraini father may not leave Bahrain without their father\'s permission.
            Dual citizenship

            Dual citizenship is not legally recognized, which may limit the ability of Canadian

            than 5,000 taka and export more than 500 taka.

            Property disputes, including those between family members, are common and can turn
            violent. You should contact a local lawyer if you find yourself in such a situation.

            Muslims are prohibited from consuming alcohol. Transgressions could be punished by
            detention or other penalties.

            Culture

            Bangladesh prides itself on being a secular nation with a predominantly Muslim
            population. Local laws reflect the fact that Bangladesh has strongly conservative social
            norms.

            Dress conservatively, behave discreetly, and respect religious and social traditions to
            avoid offending local sensitivities. Women in particular should avoid wearing shorts and
            sleeveless garments.

            Public displays of affection are not socially acceptable.
            Money

            The currency is the taka (BDT). Credit cards are becoming more widely accepted; however,
            exercise caution when using them. Incidents of credit card fraud have been reported at
            automated banking machines (ABMs) and with merchants in Dhaka. Traveller\'s cheques can
            be exchanged at banks and at the airport in Dhaka. U.S. dollar traveller\'s cheques are

            Naturalized Canadians do not automatically lose their Belarusian citizenship and are
            subject to Belarusian laws regarding citizenship and military service.
            Identification

            Always carry your passport, visa and migration card as you may be asked to prove your

            Homosexual activity is legal but is not widely accepted in Belarusian society.
            Driving laws

            An International Driving Permit is required.

            When travelling by private vehicle, you are required to show ownership documents or a
            "power of attorney" letter at border crossings. These documents must be translated into
            Belarusian and certified at a Belarusian embassy. Third-party car insurance is mandatory
            and can only be purchased upon entry into Belarus.

            Drivers of foreign vehicles must pay a fee to use Belarusian highways. Payments are
            collected at border checkpoints and vary according to the length of stay. Tolls are
            collected on major highways and payment is required in a foreign currency (euro, U.S.
            dollar, or Russian ruble).

            Vehicles must have their lights on at all times from November 1 to March 31.

            There is zero tolerance for driving under the influence of alcohol.
            Money

            The currency is the Belarusian ruble (BYB/BYR).

            Credit cards are accepted by many hotels and stores, especially in Minsk. However,
            beware of credit-card fraud. Automated banking machines (ABMs) are available in major
            cities to withdraw rubles. Traveller\'s cheques are not accepted for payment but can be
            exchanged at a bank for rubles.

            You must pay for goods and services in Belarusian rubles. The use of foreign currency in
            cash transactions is prohibited; you can face arrest if you attempt to buy an item with
            currency other than Belarusian rubles. Exchange foreign currency at government-licensed
            booths only. A valid passport must be presented to purchase foreign currency.

            When crossing one of the external border control points of the European Union (EU), you
            must make a declaration to customs upon entry or exit if you have at least â‚¬10,000 or
            the equivalent in other currencies. The sum can be in cash, cheques, money orders,
            traveller\'s cheques or any other convertible assets. This does not apply if you are
            travelling within the EU or in transit to a non-EU country. For more information on the

            Illegal drugs

            Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are strict. Convicted
            offenders can expect jail sentences and heavy fines.
            Road travel

            You must be at least 18 years of age to drive a car in Belgium. An International Driver
            Permit (IDP) is recommended for visitors.

            A Canadian driver\'s licence and an IDP are no longer valid once you have obtained
            residence status in Belgium. Before it expires, you may exchange your driver\'s licence
            from the provinces of Alberta, New Brunswick, Ontario or Quebec for a Belgian driver\'s
            licence in the Belgian municipality where you reside.

            If you hold a driver\'s licence from another province, you should check with provincial
            licence authorities whether reciprocal recognition with Belgium has been established. To
            obtain a Belgian driver\'s licence, you must pass courses and tests, and expect to wait
            six months to a year to be able to drive legally and unaccompanied.

            Speeding causes many accidents. Strict laws are in place to improve traffic safety.
            Speed traps, cameras and unmarked vehicles are in operation throughout the country.
            Fines for exceeding the speed limit are very high and police can collect them on the
            spot. Vehicles may be impounded for failure to pay.

            Penalties for drinking and driving are strict. The legal blood alcohol limit is 0.05
            percent. Convicted offenders can expect heavy fines, and driver\'s licences may be
            confiscated immediately.

            The use of a cellular telephone while driving is prohibited, unless fitted with a
            hands-free device.

            whether it has been processed or not, cannot be owned or removed from the country
            without a government permit or a receipt from a licensed shop. All souvenirs are subject
            to the National Trophy Law, and travellers must present a receipt from a licensed store
            upon departure. It is strictly prohibited to remove elephant hair, ivory and rhinoceros
            horn products.

            the penal code is applicable to Muslims and non-Muslims.

            Immigration regulations are strict. Foreign workers who overstay their visas face harsh
            penalties, including jail sentences and caning. If you are working in Brunei, closely

            Political activism (including the dissemination of printed materials), protests,
            demonstrations and unauthorized assemblies are not tolerated in Burma.

            Freedom of speech and political activities are highly circumscribed, and the Burmese
            government is very sensitive to any expression of opposition to its rule. Foreigners
            criticizing the regime in public may be arrested or detained.

            You must show your passport and valid visa at the airport, train stations and hotels.

            Customs officials strictly limit what is brought into the country. Customs regulations
            are restrictive and rigorously enforced. Baggage may be searched upon arrival. It is
            illegal to enter or exit Burma with religious materials. Foreign currency in excess of
            US$10,000 must be declared upon arrival; failure to do so could result in imprisonment.
            In the past, importation of communications equipment such as mobile phones and laptop
            computers has been restricted. Laptop computers have been taken from tourists and held
            at the airport until their departure. Customs regulations on prohibited imports and
            exports are often unclear and can change. Further advice regarding imports and exports
            should be sought from the nearest Embassy or Consulate of the Republic of the Union of
            Myanmar.

            A permit is required to purchase or possess cultural or archaeological artifacts. It is
            illegal to export gems. Foreigners have been arrested, searched and imprisoned for

            Photography of scenes or people that could be considered politically sensitive such as
            military installations, security personnel or demonstrations is prohibited. Offenders
            could be arrested, deported, and have their equipment confiscated.

            Missionary activities and the importation of religious materials are illegal without the
            written permission of the Burmese authorities.

            Homosexual activity is illegal.

            avoid offending local sensitivities.
            Money

            The currency is the kyat (MMK). U.S. currency is widely accepted; however, only new and
            undamaged bank notes are accepted. Other foreign currencies are not normally accepted.
            Foreign Exchange Certificates (FECs), which have the same face value as the U.S. dollar,
            are issued by the Burmese government. FECs can be exchanged for MMKs or used in place of
            cash to pay for goods and services where FECs are the accepted form of payment, although
            such places are increasingly rare. There are a few official currency exchange offices in
            Yangon, including one at the Yangon International Airport. It is illegal to exchange
            currency at unauthorized locations. Neither FECs nor MMKs can be converted to any other
            currency.

            Carry enough cash to cover all of your expenses while in Burma. Credit cards are rarely
            accepted. Debit cards and traveller\'s cheques are not accepted. There are no

            driving licence. The same applies for riding motorcycles; an International Driving
            Permit with a motorcycle endorsement must be exchanged for a Cambodian motorcycle
            licence. A fee of US$32 is charged for the exchange. Helmets are mandatory for
            motorcycle drivers and passengers, but many helmets do not meet international safety
            standards. Ensure your medical insurance will cover you when riding as a driver or
            passenger.

            A permit is required to purchase or possess cultural or archaeological artefacts.

            The sexual exploitation of minors is a serious offence in Cambodia and is subject to
            harsh penalties. Canadians may also be subject to criminal proceedings in Canada for
            acts of this nature committed while abroad. Consult our publication entitled Child Sex
            Tourism: It\'s a Crime for further information on the risks of committing this form of

            Commercial surrogacy

            Commercial surrogacy is illegal in Cambodia, carrying penalties including imprisonment
            and/or fines. If you are visiting Cambodia for the purposes of commercial surrogacy
            arrangements, you should seek independent legal advice before entering into any
            agreement. If you have already entered into such an arrangement, you should also seek
            advice from a local lawyer on how this legislation could affect your situation and, in
            particular, on any exit requirements.
            Culture

            Dress conservatively, behave discreetly and respect religious and social traditions to

            people in uniform. Always ask permission before photographing individuals. An
            International Driving Permit is required for visits of up to one year in Cameroon. A
            Canadian licence alone is not acceptable. If you intend to drive in Cameroon for more
            than one year, you will require a Cameroonian driver\'s licence. To obtain a Cameroonian
            driver\'s licence from local authorities, you are required to present your Canadian
            driver\'s licence to the Delegation of Public Transport in your town of residence. The
            process usually takes only 24 hours.
            Money

            The currency is the African Financial Community CFA franc (or XAF bank code), which is
            also used in Chad, the Central African Republic, Congo, Gabon and Equatorial Guinea. The
            West African CFA franc is not valid in Cameroon, and cannot be used or exchanged. The
            economy is cash-based.

            Euros and U.S. dollars are accepted in major stores and hotels. Credit cards are rarely
            accepted outside major international hotels. VISA cash advance, money wire-transfer and
            automated banking machine (ABM) cash services are available at major banks. There are no
            American Express offices.

            Money transfer out of Cameroon is regulated, and you must obtain authorization from the
            Ministry of Finance for any such transaction. Transferring funds through a bank is
            time-consuming, and charges are levied. Traveller\'s cheques can only be cashed at two
            major hotels in YaoundÃ© (the Hilton and Mont FÃ©bÃ©) and in banks. Due to forgeries and
            recent robberies, banks and hotels will cash traveller\'s cheques only if they are
            accompanied by the original purchase receipt. Whereas Canadian dollars are accepted in
            some financial institutions and exchange bureaus, Canadian-currency travellers\' cheques
            are generally not accepted.

            High-quality counterfeit new 10,000 CFA franc banknotes have been discovered in
            circulation in CFA franc zone countries. You should avoid offers of large amounts of
            banknotes in exchange for foreign currency from anyone other than a reputable exchange
            bureau.

            Business travellers who wish to establish a presence in Cameroon should first employ the
            services of a local agent. Caution should be exercised when pursuing venture capital and
            licensing arrangements. Business people interested in opportunities in Cameroon are
            encouraged to contact the commercial section at the High Commission of Canada in
            YaoundÃ© for information.

            Imports and exports

            Local customs authorities may enforce strict regulations concerning the temporary import
            or export of items such as firearms, spear guns, medications, agricultural products, and
            animals (including sea turtle products). Note that anything delivering a projectile is

            (VISA, the French Carte bleue) and traveller\'s cheques are accepted only in major
            hotels in Bangui (Sofitel, Central Hotel and Somba Hotel). It is recommended that
            traveller\'s cheques be issued in euros.

            The exchange rate for cash is much lower than for traveller\'s cheques, but the banks

            The currency is the Central African Franc (CFA) which is also used in Cameroon, Central
            African Republic, Congo, Gabon and Equatorial Guinea. There are no import restrictions
            on local or foreign currencies, provided they are declared upon arrival. The export of
            local currency is prohibited and the export of foreign currency is limited to the amount
            declared upon arrival. Proof of entry of money must be processed through one of the
            local commercial banks.

            There are currently no automated banking machines (ABMs) in Chad. Credit cards are
            accepted only at the two major hotels in N\'Djamena and at Air France, the major

            with caution. Small amounts of local currency can be negotiated on major credit cards
            from several banks. Canadian currency and Canadian dollar traveller\'s cheques are not

            Laws

            To combat high levels of pollution in winter, restrictions on driving in central
            Santiago (within the ring road) are imposed from June to September. The last two digits
            of the licence plate number determine which days of the month a vehicle cannot be
            driven. These lists are published in newspapers. Temporary bans may be imposed on up to
            60 percent of city traffic when levels of pollution are extremely high.

            An International Driving Permit is recommended.
            Money

            The currency is the Chilean peso (CLP). U.S. dollars (but not Canadian dollars) are
            easily exchanged across the country. Purchases in U.S. dollars can only be done in
            certain stores in Santiago. Credit cards are usually accepted in hotels and restaurants
            in major tourist and business destinations, but they are often not accepted in locally
            owned small hotels and restaurants, including in Santiago. For convenience, carry
            traveller\'s cheques in U.S. currency.

            Canadian business travellers have been detained and had their passports confiscated as a
            result of business disputes with their Chinese counterparts. Seek legal advice from
            professionals in China, as well as in Canada, before proceeding with business agreements
            or arrangements. Ensure that all documents are translated so that conditions, terms and
            limitations are understood. Disputes are often costly and prolonged. Consult the website
            of the Government of Canada for more information about Doing Business with China.

            Canadian and international driving licences are not recognized in China. Foreigners must
            hold a foreigner residence permit and meet local requirements to obtain a Chinese
            driver\'s licence.

            Travel near military installations is restricted.

            Carefully consider the implications of driving in China. Foreigners driving in China
            face harsh penalties if they are involved in an accident. Police officers have the right
            to detain foreigners suspected of being responsible for road accidents until their case
            is closed, which can take years. It is not uncommon for foreigners to be blamed for
            accidents even though they are not at fault.

            There are absolute prohibitions against arms, drugs, and plant or animal products
            considered infested with disease or pests. There are also restrictions on the entry of
            printed matter, film, photos, videotapes and CDs considered detrimental to the interests
            of China.

            Canadians who intend to reside in China are advised that only one pet (dog or cat) per
            person can be imported. A Canadian animal health inspection certificate and vaccination
            certificate should be stamped by your local office of the Canadian Food Inspection
            Agency. Animals without the proper documentation will be held in quarantine at the port
            of arrival and could be destroyed if the proper documentation is not provided.

            There are restrictions on certain religious activities, such as preaching, distributing
            literature and associating with unapproved religious groups, including some Christian,
            Buddhist and Muslim organizations. The Falun Gong movement has been banned in China.
            Participants in Falun Gong activities or Falun Gong-related demonstrations are subject
            to legal action that may include detention, deportation, arrest and imprisonment.

            Photography of military installations or government buildings may result in a penalty.
            Seek permission from local authorities before taking photographs.
            Teaching English

            There are many opportunities for teaching English in China. However, make sure you are
            well informed before signing a contract. Ensure that the contract specifies the maximum
            number of classroom hours per day and per week, maximum work days per week, and vacation
            periods. Canadians teaching in China, particularly at newly established private
            secondary schools and private English training centres, have often found their employers
            unable or unwilling to honour contract terms or to assist in obtaining Chinese
            employment visas and other permits required for foreigners to teach lawfully in China.
            If you are travelling to China to work or study, you may be required to possess medical
            insurance (coverage of 400,000 renminbi). Verify this stipulation with the school or
            employer prior to arriving in China. It is illegal to work on a tourist (L) visa or on a
            working (Z) visa linked to a company other than your employer. Canadian citizens have
            been detained and forced to leave the country for working illegally.
            Money

            The currency is the renminbi (RMB). The basic unit of currency is the yuan. Counterfeit
            renminbi are relatively common, especially in southern China. It is illegal to use
            foreign currency. Exchange foreign currency at officially approved facilities only.
            Traveller\'s cheques can be exchanged at most hotels. Generally only international
            hotels and some larger shops accept international credit cards. Some Chinese banks will
            provide cash advances using credit card accounts, but they may charge for the service.
            It is possible to use bank cards to draw on your Canadian bank account at an increasing
            number of automated banking machines, especially in urban areas.

            Illegal drugs

            Sentences for drug-related offences are severe. Monitor your luggage closely at all
            times. Never transport other people\'s packages or change money for strangers.
            Laws

            Colombian law prohibits travellers from bringing firearms into Colombia. Illegal
            importation or possession of firearms may result in lengthy prison sentences.

            It is also prohibited to export certain cultural artifacts.

            It is a serious criminal offence to have sex with minors in Colombia. Conviction may
            result in a lengthy prison sentence.

            In the event of a car accident, the drivers involved must remain at the scene and not
            move their vehicles until the authorities arrive. Failure to do so may result in
            problems with Colombian law enforcement.

            An international driving permit is required.
            Money

            The currency is the Colombian peso (COP). Canadian traveller\'s cheques and cash are not
            accepted in Colombia; however, U.S. currency and traveller\'s cheques are widely
            accepted. Colombian automated banking machines (ABMs) accept most Canadian bank cards,
            making it possible to withdraw Colombian pesos.

            Laws

            Canada and Costa Rica are signatories to the European Convention on the Transfer of
            Sentenced Persons, which enables a Canadian imprisoned in Costa Rica to request to be
            transferred to Canada to complete the sentence in a Canadian prison. The transfer
            requires the agreement of both Canadian and Costa Rican authorities.

            If you violate Costa Rica\'s laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested or
            imprisoned.

            Costa Rican immigration authorities state that all foreigners must carry original
            identification documents; however, local authorities will accept photocopies as long as
            the original documents are accessible.

            It is illegal to photograph official buildings. Verify with local authorities before
            taking photos.

            The Costa Rican government is actively trying to discourage sex tourism. Soliciting the
            services of a minor for sexual purposes is illegal in Costa Rica and is punishable by
            imprisonment.

            Traffic enforcement is the responsibility of the transit police (dial 2222 9330 or 2222
            9245). Transit officers often perform roadside inspection of vehicles and request the
            driver\'s licence, vehicle registration and insurance documents. Traffic fines are not
            supposed to be collected on site. Travellers involved in driving accidents should call
            911 to notify authorities of the accident. Do not move the vehicle until advised to do
            so by the police.
            Rentals

            Terms and conditions of car rentals in Costa Rica are unlike most contracts in North
            America. You should carefully review contracts and ensure that you have appropriate
            insurance coverage, including mandatory liability coverage. Many driving situations can
            nullify insurance.
            Money

            The currency is the Costa Rican colÃ³n (CRC). To avoid complications, carry U.S. dollars
            or colones. It is advisable to exchange money at registered banks and exchange offices.
            Credit cards are widely accepted. Credit card fraud is a growing problem.

            It is extremely difficult to exchange Canadian currency and traveller\'s cheques in
            Canadian dollars in Costa Rica. The maximum amount of traveller\'s cheques that may be
            cashed at one time is $500. Access to cash via automated banking machines (ABMs) is
            available in major cities; only local currency can be withdrawn.

            Art objects purchased in CÃ´te d\'Ivoire must be accompanied by an export permit
            provided by the MusÃ©e National (national museum).

            An International Driving Permit is recommended.
            Money

            The currency is the African Financial Community franc (XOF). Credit cards are accepted
            at major hotels, some restaurants and some shops. Most commercial establishments and
            banks do not accept travellers\' cheques, either in U.S. dollars or in euros. Automated
            teller machines are available in Abidjan and most major cities. Money transfer services
            (such as Western Union and MoneyGram) are also available.

            Canadian and Croatian authorities.
            Dual citizenship

            Although dual citizenship is formally recognized, the police have been known to ignore a
            Croatian\'s second nationality. You should travel using your Canadian passport and
            present yourself as Canadian to foreign authorities at all times. Dual citizens are
            strongly advised to contact the nearest Croatian embassy or consulate well before
            departure in order to seek advice on any required administrative procedures. Failure to
            do so may also subject dual Canadian-Croatian citizens to national obligations, such as
            taxes. See Travelling as a dual citizen for more information.
            Illegal drugs

            Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are strict. Convicted
            offenders can expect jail sentences and heavy fines.
            Driving laws

            An International Driving Permit is recommended.

            Seat belt use is mandatory, as is the use of car seats for infants. Children under 12
            years of age are not allowed to sit in the front passenger seat.

            The use of a cellular telephone while driving is prohibited, unless the phone is fitted
            with a hands-free device.

            The use of headlights is required when driving during winter (from the last weekend in
            October until the last weekend in March)--even during daytime--as well as during fog and
            other inclement weather.

            Motorists must wear a fluorescent vest when attending to a car breakdown along the road.

            When driving, a vehicle coming from the right has the right of way, unless otherwise
            indicated. Right turns at red lights are prohibited. Failure to respect these laws may
            result in fines.

            Penalties for drinking and driving are strict. Police undertake routine spot checks.
            Convicted offenders can expect heavy fines and jail sentences. The legal blood alcohol
            limit is 0.05 percent, but there is zero tolerance for driving under the influence of
            alcohol when a motorist or boat operator is involved in an accident. In the event that
            an accident causes serious injury or death, police will take blood samples to test
            alcohol levels. You are advised to seek legal counsel immediately if you are charged
            following an accident.
            Money

            The currency is the Croatian kuna (HRK).

            All major Western currencies are easily exchanged for local currency. Keep receipts to
            reconvert kuna to foreign currency. Credit cards and traveller\'s cheques are accepted
            by most banks and hotels. Automated banking machines are widely available in urban
            centres.

            When crossing one of the external border control points of the European Union (EU), you
            must make a declaration to customs upon entry or exit if you have at least â‚¬10,000 or
            the equivalent in other currencies. The sum can be in cash, cheques, money orders,
            traveller\'s cheques or any other convertible assets. This does not apply if you are
            travelling within the EU or in transit to a non-EU country. For more information on the
            EU legislation and links to EU countries\' sites, visit the European Commission\'s Cash

        <item>Laws

            Canadian consular officials may be accompanied by Cuban authorities during visits with
            Canadians who have been arrested or detained.

            Under the Cuban judicial system, charges are not laid until the investigation is
            complete, and the accused may be jailed during the entire period of investigation.
            Although Cuba retains the death penalty, to date it has never been applied in the case
            of a foreign offender.

            Crimes such as drug trafficking, assault, sexual assault, and assisting in illegal
            migration of people are punishable by long prison sentences. Drinking and driving is
            against the law. The blood alcohol content limit for drivers in Cuba has been set at .04
            percent (40 mg of alcohol per 100 ml of blood).

            Avoid military zones and any other restricted or heavily guarded areas. These are not
            always identified. Photographing military or police installations or personnel, or
            harbour, rail and airport facilities, is forbidden.

            All electronic devices with Global Positioning System technology, including cellular
            telephones, are illegal and may be confiscated upon entry to Cuba.

            Traffic accidents are a frequent cause of arrest and detention of Canadians in Cuba.
            Accidents resulting in death or injury are treated as crimes, and the onus is on the
            driver to prove innocence. Regardless of the nature of the accident, it can take five
            months to a year for a case to go to trial. In most cases, the driver will not be
            allowed to leave Cuba until the trial has taken place. In some cases, the driver will be
            imprisoned during this delay.
            Vehicle rentals

            Be cautious when renting a vehicle in Cuba. Although insurance is offered, coverage
            differs from that in Canada. Contract agreements do not cover occasional drivers;
            therefore, the signatory is responsible for all people driving the vehicle. If you are
            found to be at fault in any way in an accident, rental agencies will nullify your
            coverage and seek damages to cover the cost of repairs, which can be very high.

            Avoid renting scooters, as thieves target them and you may be responsible for the cost
            of their replacement.

            Rental agencies are government-controlled and can prevent you from leaving the country
            unless they receive payment.
            Sex tourism

            Cuba is actively working to prevent child sex tourism, and a number of tourists,
            including Canadians, have been convicted of offences related to the corruption of minors
            aged 16 and under. Prison sentences range from 7 to 25 years. Release on bail before
            trial is unlikely.
            Dual citizenship

            Under Cuban law, the Government of Canada cannot provide consular services to Canadian
            nationals or to permanent residents of Canada with Cuban citizenship.
            Boat traffic

            The U.S. government closely monitors boat traffic in the Straits of Florida. Officials
            will seize any vessel without a licence from the Office of Foreign Assets Control if
            they believe it is headed for Cuba. Canadians who dock their Canadian-registered boats
            in Florida are subject to these measures, whereas those Canadian boats simply en route
            to Cuba via the U.S. will be exempt. However, expect to be thoroughly searched and
            questioned if you are in the latter category.
            Imports and exports

            Articles prohibited from entry into Cuba include drugs, explosives, pornographic
            material, literature considered subversive, perishable food items, radio transmission
            equipment, wireless microphones, radio and TV receivers differing from household models,
            global positioning systems (GPS), satellite receiver antennas and stations, air
            conditioners, and small appliances that draw heavily on electricity. Such items are
            routinely seized on arrival without compensation.

            Cuban customs officials may also seize any imported item that they do not consider to be
            for the tourist\'s personal use.

            Cuban customs may apply steep tariffs for travellers whose personal baggage exceeds 30
            kg or who are carrying more than 10 kg of medication.

            Donations of any type, whether by individuals, organizations or businesses, must be
            coordinated through the Embassy of Cuba in Canada.

            You may export up to 20 cigars from Cuba without documentation or up to 50 cigars if
            they are in the original container, closed and sealed with the official hologram. If
            exceeding that amount, you must also provide a guarantee of origin certificate. Failure
            to comply with this regulation will lead to the seizure of the cigars without
            compensation. Art objects (including artifacts and paintings) purchased in Cuba must be
            accompanied by an export permit (usually provided by state-owned galleries). Otherwise,
            items must be registered with the Registro Nacional de Bienes Culturales, Calle 17, No.
            1009 e/10 y 12, Vedado, tel.: 53-7-833-9658.

            It is forbidden to leave Cuba with illegally purchased lobsters. Authorities can impose
            heavy fines and require the offender to pay before leaving the country.

            For detailed information on import and export requirements, please consult the Cuban
            Customs Administration.
            Black market

            Travellers may be approached and offered black-market goods, such as cigars, or asked to
            change dollars for Cuban convertible pesos. Engaging in black-market transactions is
            illegal and can lead to difficulties with the Cuban authorities. Never transport
            packages for strangers. Pack all luggage yourself.
            Marriage

            Marriage to a Cuban citizen does not guarantee your spouse immediate access to Canada.
            The immigration process takes at least 10 months, and you must initiate the sponsorship
            in Canada. For additional information, consult Citizenship and Immigration Canada.

            Marrying a Cuban does not automatically entitle you to live with your spouse in Cuba,
            even for just a few days. To be able to stay in your spouse\'s residence, you must have
            a personal visa so that you are properly registered with local authorities. Your spouse
            can be fined or jailed if you do not follow the rules. Cubans accompanying foreign
            visitors, especially in bars and hotels, may be asked for identification papers and
            denied entry.

            Canadians wishing to marry a Cuban in Cuba may visit the Web site of the Embassy of Cuba
            in Canada for more information on required documents and procedures.

            Two Canadians who have never been married before need to present the following documents
            to be married in Cuba:

            a) valid passport; and

            b) the tourist card obtained upon arrival.

            If either of the Canadians has been married before, in addition to a valid passport and
            tourist card, he or she must produce the following documents:

            a) if divorced, the certificate of divorce;

            b) if widowed, the certificate of marriage and the spouse\'s death certificate.

            Furthermore, these certificates must be legalized and authenticated by Canadian
            authorities, translated into typewritten Spanish, without errors or corrections, and
            then forwarded to the Cuban embassy or a Cuban consulate in Canada for legalization and
            authentication.
            Money

            Cuba has two official currencies: the Cuban convertible peso (CUC) and the national peso
            (moneda nacional or MN). Transactions involving foreigners almost always take place in
            CUC. However, visitors should familiarize themselves with the moneda nacional, since it
            is a common scam for merchants to give change in moneda nacional instead of CUC. The CUC
            is worth substantially more than the MN.
            Accessing funds in Cuba

            Canadians often encounter problems accessing funds while in Cuba. Debit cards and
            Canadian money transfers are not accepted. Additionally, Canadian money transfers are
            not accepted by Western Union in Cuba. Credit cards are not widely accepted; in
            particular, those issued by American financial institutions, such as American Express
            cards, and some credit cards issued by certain Canadian financial institutions
            affiliated with American banks, are not accepted. Other credit cards are generally
            accepted at major establishments such as state-run hotels and restaurants and
            international resort chains. Private restaurants (paladares) and private guest houses
            (casas particulares) do not accept credit cards of any kind. Credit card cash advances
            (in CUCs) may be obtained at banks, hotels or Cadeca exchange houses.

            Automated banking machines (ABMs) are rare and do not always work in Cuba. In Havana,
            cash advances in CUCs from Visa cards can be obtained from the ABMs located in the
            Miramar Trade Centre and in some hotels. In Varadero, ABMs are located in the Plaza
            America and at banks. If you use an ABM, do so during business hours at a location
            inside a bank or large commercial building. Leave copies of your card numbers with a
            family member in case of emergency.

            Most foreign currencies can be exchanged at Cadeca exchange houses, found in Cuba\'s
            international airports and in urban areas, as well as in banks and major hotels.
            Canadian currency (cash and traveller\'s cheques) may be exchanged for CUC without fees.
            American Express traveller\'s cheques are accepted at certain banks. Keep receipts for
            traveller\'s cheques separate. Australian dollars cannot be exchanged anywhere on the
            island. Exchange of U.S. currency is possible, but is subject to an additional fee.

            It is against Cuban law to remove CUCs from Cuba. They can be exchanged for U.S. dollars
            (and Canadian dollars, if available) at international airports before leaving the
            country. It is not possible to exchange CUCs outside of Cuba.

            The currency is the Congolese franc (or CDF bank code). Payments can be made in foreign
            currency, particularly U.S. dollars. Merchants and foreign exchange dealers do, however,
            require that foreign currency be in good condition (not torn) and recently issued
            (American bills with large heads), due to the amount of counterfeit currency in
            circulation.

            Credit cards and travellers\' cheques are not generally accepted, apart from major
            institutions such as the Memling Hotel and the Grand Hotel in Kinshasa. Keep and

            image, film or audio-visual recording considered contrary to accepted standards of
            behaviour. The prohibition on the use of drugs must be respected. Consumption of alcohol

        <item>Illegal drugs

            Persons convicted of buying, selling, carrying or using any type or quantity of drug are
            subject to strict penalties. Judicial processes may last several years (during which
            accused individuals are normally detained) and could lead to long prison sentences in
            harsh conditions.
            Laws

            Dominican law stipulates that victims of crime (including foreigners) are responsible
            for reporting incidents to police. Victims who wish to pursue prosecution or seek
            compensation must retain Dominican legal counsel to file a formal complaint to the
            police and to pursue the case through the justice system. The official language of the
            Dominican Republic is Spanish. You should expect all documents to be in Spanish and not
            English or French.

            An International Driving Permit is required.
            Dual citizenship

            Dual citizenship is legally recognized. However, in the judicial system, citizens of
            Dominican origin are considered Dominican citizens. Therefore, Canadian consular
            officials may be limited in their ability to provide consular services.
            Real estate

            Many Canadians have reported financial problems and complications involving time-share
            arrangements and other property investment activities. Exercise caution whenever
            approached by time-share representatives as pressure sales techniques are used. Do not
            reveal personal information or provide your credit card unless you are certain you wish
            to make a purchase.

            Before making any real estate or land investment, consult Dominican and Canadian lawyers
            with relevant experience, and exercise extreme caution. Land deeds should be carefully
            verified. Ensure that constant vigilance of land will take place, as there have been
            several instances of disputed land occupation in the absence of the alleged owner. The
            Embassy of Canada in Santo Domingo cannot intervene in legal matters, and cannot give
            legal advice regarding land purchases or disputes.
            Marriage

            Marriages legally performed in compliance with the laws of the Dominican Republic are
            recognized in Canada. For information on required documentation and procedures, contact
            the Embassy of the Dominican Republic in Ottawa.
            Money

            Upon departure from the Dominican Republic, you cannot export more than US$10,000 or its
            equivalent in another currency.

            The currency is the Dominican peso (DOP). U.S. dollars are widely accepted, but Canadian
            currency is not. Canadian currency and traveller\'s cheques can be exchanged at most
            commercial banks and exchange booths or offices (casas de cambio) and in resort areas
            and major tourist hotels. Currency should be exchanged only at banks, official exchange
            booths and casas de cambio.

        <item>Illegal drugs

            Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are severe. Individuals
            may be found guilty by association if they have criminal associates. Drivers should not
            accept hitchhikers, as they could be held responsible for them as well as for the
            content of their luggage. Monitor your luggage at all times when travelling, especially
            at airports, and never agree to carry items for another person.
            Laws

            It is a legal requirement in Ecuador to carry identification at all times.

        <item>Laws

            The state of emergency (Emergency Law), which had been in effect since 1981, was lifted
            on May 31, 2012. While this represents an increase in civil liberties, you are advised
            to exercise restraint and common sense during the transition period.

            The use of drugs and open consumption of alcohol (other than in licensed facilities such
            as hotels and restaurants) are prohibited. Transgressions could be punished by detention
            or other penalties.

            Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are strict. Convicted
            offenders can expect jail sentences and heavy fines. Capital punishment is a sentencing
            option for certain drug-related crimes.

            Photography of bridges, canals, including the Suez Canal, government, police and embassy
            buildings and vehicles, as well as military personnel and establishments is prohibited.

            An International Driving Permit (IDP) is recommended.
            Customs

            Strict duties apply on the importation of expensive electronics, including video and
            photographic equipment, laptops, and computer software and hardware. Such equipment
            should be for personal use and you should list it (model and serial number) and check it
            upon arrival and departure, in which case no duty will be collected. Appropriate permits
            and authorizations are required for the commercial importation of any type of
            electronics. It is prohibited to export any antiquity or any item older than 100 years
            without a licence. Contact the Embassy of the Arab Republic of Egypt in Ottawa for
            further information regarding customs requirements.
            Forced marriages

            There are reports of Canadian citizens being forced into marriage without their prior
            knowledge or consent. For more information about forced marriages, please consult our
            Marriage Overseas FAQs and our publication entitled Her Own Way: A Woman\'s Guide to

            Dual citizenship

            You may be considered an Egyptian citizen if you were born in Egypt or were born outside
            Egypt to an Egyptian father. Consular assistance by the Embassy of Canada is unlikely to
            be permitted by the Egyptian authorities and may therefore be extremely limited.

            Egyptian-Canadian men may be subject to military service when in Egypt. In order to be
            exempted, before leaving Egypt dual citizens are required to present many documents,
            among them a document of discharge due to dual citizenship. This document does not
            necessarily provide an exemption; getting this document may be a drawn-out process that
            could affect your departure date; and the Canadian government has no jurisdiction in the
            process. In the end, military service for Egyptian men is the decision of the Egyptian
            government. You should contact the Egyptian embassy or consulate in Canada before
            travelling.

            See Travelling as a dual citizen for more information.
            Culture

            The work week is Sunday through Thursday.

            Overt public displays of intimate affection are frowned upon in Egyptian culture.
            Demonstrations of homosexuality have been deemed an affront to public morals, and some
            Egyptian homosexuals have been jailed.

            Islamic practices and beliefs are adhered to in the country\'s customs, laws and
            regulations. Exercise common sense and discretion in dress and behaviour. Dress
            conservatively: for women, knee-length or longer dresses and long sleeves are
            preferable, and men should not wear shorts outside tourist areas. Respect religious and
            social traditions to avoid offending local sensitivities.
            Money

            The currency is the Egyptian pound (EGP).

            A maximum of EGP 5,000 can be brought into or taken out of Egypt.

            Traveller\'s cheques and foreign currency are easily exchanged in hotels and banks. U.S.
            dollars are preferred, particularly at tourist sites. It has become common practice for
            some travel agents and tour operators to request that payment be made in U.S. cash only.

            Major credit cards are accepted in larger stores and for larger purchases, but many
            merchants will accept only cash or may charge a fee for payment by credit card.
            MasterCard may be refused in banks, hotels, shops, and by travel agents because of its

            You must obtain approval from the El Salvador Department of Foreign Affairs to attend
            international conferences. If permission is granted, you may participate only as an
            observer, not as an activist or lobbyist for a particular political position.

            To own or carry a firearm, you require a permit issued in El Salvador. Carrying
            unregistered firearms is punishable by a prison sentence.

            Salvadoran authorities will accept a valid Canadian driver\'s licence if it is presented
            with a valid Canadian passport. However, an International Driving Permit is recommended
            for travel between countries.
            Money

            The official currency is the U.S. dollar (USD). Although the colÃ³n (SVC) still exists,
            it is not in circulation. Traveller\'s cheques in U.S. dollars can be changed in major
            hotels and banks when presented with a valid passport. Ask for small denominations ($1,
            $5, $10), since US$50 and US$100 bills are not widely accepted and can expose you to
            greater risk of robbery.

            The import or possession of camouflage clothing, large knives, binoculars, firearms, or
            similar items may be deemed suspicious by authorities. These items could be confiscated
            and you could be detained. Satellite phones are legally permissible, but not all
            immigration officials may be aware of this. If stopped, make an effort to speak to a
            higher authority, or if you are forced to leave the satellite phone with an official,
            ensure that you receive a receipt or some other identification of the confiscator to

            officials to provide consular services. You should travel using your Canadian passport
            and present yourself as Canadian to foreign authorities at all times. See Travelling as
            a dual citizen for more information.

            in a vehicle near a restricted area, no matter the reason.

            Tourist souvenirs are often copies of Ethiopian antiques or religious paraphernalia. It
            is important to have a proper receipt that clearly indicates that a purchased item is a
            souvenir and not authentic, as the exportation of real antiques or religious items is
            not permitted. Receipts should be carried on your person when travelling. It should be
            noted, however, that even upon presenting such documents, items purchased for

            referred to as 3 a.m. Julian time).

            The Ethiopian highlands are predominantly Orthodox Christian. There is fasting in this
            region each Wednesday and Friday, and during Lent. Primarily vegetarian dishes are
            available during this period (except in large hotels).

            Always obtain permission from religious authorities before visiting churches.

            US$3,000 (or its equivalent in any convertible foreign currency) unless also carrying a
            bank advice certifying the purchase of the foreign currency or a customs declaration
            form completed upon entry. Even the provision of such documents may not safeguard you
            against confiscation of the extra funds, imprisonment or fines. You must declare foreign
            currencies upon arrival and may be required to present this declaration when applying
            for an exit visa.

            Exchange foreign currency at banks or official foreign exchange offices only, as

            Official exchange rates are close to black-market rates.

            Credit cards are not widely accepted except by large hotels, travel agencies, and a few
            shops and restaurants in Addis Ababa. Take hard-currency cash or traveller\'s cheques to
            Ethiopia. Traveller\'s cheques can be cashed at the Commercial Bank of Ethiopia or at
            any privately owned bank.

            Ghana\'s currency was redenominated in 2007. The new Ghanaian currency, the Ghana cedi
            (GHS), has progressively replaced the old cedi and, since January 2008, the old cedi can
            only be converted at the Bank of Ghana.

            The export of cedis is prohibited. There are no restrictions on the import and export of
            foreign currencies provided that they are declared upon arrival and exchanged for local
            currency only through banks and foreign exchange bureaus. Visitors may receive an
            Exchange Control Form T-5 on arrival; if not, travellers may request it. Foreign
            currency and all transactions made while in the country must be recorded on this form.
            This form should be safely stored; its loss can result in problems. Unused cedis must be
            spent or reconverted into foreign currency before departure. The T-5 declaration form
            must show that the monies obtained while in Ghana were from an authorized dealer in
            foreign exchange. Currency transactions with private citizens are illegal.

            Laws

            A Haitian driver\'s permit is required for vehicle operators staying more than three
            months A permit may be obtained on presentation of a valid provincial driver\'s licence
            or an International Driving Permit (IDP). For stays under three months, an IDP is

            overcrowded, unsanitary and under-resourced.

            Individual Canadians or Canadian organizations wishing to donate clothing, new or used
            material goods, personal care products or medications should contact the Embassy of the

            Most leading hotels accept major credit cards. American and Canadian travellers\'
            cheques are rarely accepted, and Canadian currency is never accepted. Canadian bank
            cards may be used to access funds from some automated banking machines (ABMs), but the
            withdrawal limit is much lower than in Canada. Haitian ABMs have been reported as
            unreliable in the past. They should not be depended upon in emergency situations. Be
            extremely vigilant when using ABMs in Haiti as there is a high risk of robbery.

            A motorway vignette (permit) is required when travelling on highways. You may purchase
            these electronic vignettes at a gas station. You must keep receipts for one year if the
            gas station does not issue stickers as proof of payment.

            Police do not collect fines on the spot for traffic violations, but they do issue a
            ticket indicating the amount of the fine, which can be paid at any post office. Police
            may retain the passport of a traveller who disputes a fine or offence. They will then
            issue a receipt and letter requesting that the traveller report to a police station. The
            passport is returned once the dispute is settled.

            There are strict regulations on the temporary import or export of items such as
            firearms, antiquities, electronic equipment, local currency, ivory, gold objects,
            pornographic materials and other prohibited materials. Non-residents are prohibited from

            A number of Canadians have been involved in marital fraud and dowry abuse in India. Some
            cases involve misuse of India\'s Dowry Prohibition Act. This law, enacted to protect
            women by making dowry demands a crime, is sometimes used to blackmail men through false
            allegations of dowry extortion. Individuals facing charges may be forced to remain in
            India until their cases have been settled or must compensate their spouses in exchange
            for the dismissal of charges. To avoid such problems, register your marriage in India
            along with a joint declaration of gifts exchanged, and consider a prenuptial agreement,

            Indonesia strictly enforces its immigration and visa requirements. Foreigners have been
            detained in Immigration Detention Centres for visa violations or overstays. Those in
            violation may be subject to substantial fines and deportation.

            Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are very strict and
            include the death penalty for serious drug offences. Suspects can be detained for
            prolonged periods, without the possibility of release on bail, while police conduct
            investigations prior to prosecution. Random drug testing of tourists throughout the
            country has resulted in several arrests.

            Gambling is illegal.

            Local customs authorities may enforce strict regulations concerning temporary
            importation or export of items such as medications and audiovisual material. Contact the
            Embassy of the Republic of Indonesia for specific information regarding customs
            requirements.

            Canadians are not permitted to drive in Indonesia on a Canadian driving licence but are
            permitted to use an international licence, which can be purchased locally. An
            International Driving Permit obtained in Canada may need to be endorsed by the local
            Indonesian licensing office.
            Culture

            In some areas, Islamic practices and beliefs are closely adhered to in local customs,
            laws and regulations. Dress conservatively, behave discreetly, and respect religious and
            social traditions to avoid offending local sensitivities.
            Money

            The currency is the rupiah (IDR). Credit cards are not widely accepted outside of large
            urban centres and tourist areas. There is a very high rate of credit and debit card
            fraud in Indonesia. Pay careful attention when your cards are being handled by others
            during payment processing. Indonesia is known for its high rate of online credit card
            fraud. Ensure that your card information (number, name, expiry date) is kept private.
            Keep all receipts and bills with a credit or debit card number secure or destroy them
            completely. Traveller\'s cheques can be exchanged at banks and larger hotels. Carry cash

            require an International Driving Permit.

            The work week is from Saturday to Thursday. However, many private companies and
            government offices are closed on Thursday.
            Illegal or restricted activities

            Possession, use or trafficking of drugs and alcohol is forbidden. Convicted offenders
            can expect very severe penalties, including capital punishment.

            People who challenge the Islamic faith or attempt to convert Muslims to another religion
            may be condemned to death.

            Avoid public displays of affection between two people of the opposite sex, especially
            between a non-Muslim man and a Muslim woman.

            Those who engage in sexual relations outside of marriage are subject to severe
            penalties, including death.

            Homosexual activity is a criminal offence. Those convicted may be sentenced to lashing,
            a prison sentence, and/or death.

            Magazines and DVDs with sexual or explicit content are forbidden.

            Photography of government and military installations--such as ports and airports and
            their surroundings--is strictly prohibited. Such sites are not always identifiable.
            Refrain from taking pictures whenever you are not at a recognized tourist site. When in
            doubt, ask for permission.

            Playing music loudly in public, including in cars, is prohibited by law.
            Religion

            Iran is an Islamic theocratic republic. A conservative interpretation of Islamic
            practices and beliefs is closely adhered to in the country\'s customs, laws, and
            regulations. Dress conservatively, behave discreetly, and respect religious and social
            traditions to avoid offending local sensitivities. Men should not wear shorts, and women
            should cover their head with a scarf and cover their arms and legs.

            Former Muslims who have converted to other religions have been subject to arrest and
            prosecution.
            Dual citizenship

            Male Iranian citizens aged 18 to 34 are required to perform military service, unless
            exempt. This requirement also applies to Iranian-Canadians, even those born in Canada.
            Iranian-Canadians aged 17 years or more will not be allowed to leave Iran without first
            having completed their military service.
            Marriage and divorce

            The Government of Canada can provide only very limited assistance if a Canadian woman
            married to an Iranian man has marital difficulties and/or encounters difficulties
            leaving Iran.

            Canadian women married to Iranian nationals who register their marriage with the Iranian
            authorities automatically become Iranian citizens and are deemed to be Iranian citizens
            according to Iranian law, even if they travel to Iran on a Canadian passport with an
            Iranian visa. Iranian immigration authorities often impound Canadian passports,
            particularly those of women who intend to reside in Iran. Women who are considered to be
            Iranian by marriage must have their husband\'s permission to travel and to leave Iran,
            even if they intend to use their Canadian passport.

            Iranian women married to Iranian nationals and divorced in Canada need to have their
            divorce certificate issued in Canada authenticated by Foreign Affairs and International
            Trade Canada in Ottawa. The divorce certificate must then be sanctioned by a court of
            justice in Iran in order to be valid under Iranian law.

            Iranian women married to Iranian nationals in Iran and divorced in Canada cannot use
            their Canadian divorce certificate for official purposes in Iran unless it is first
            authenticated by Foreign Affairs and International Trade Canada in Ottawa and properly
            sanctioned in Iran by a court of justice. A Canadian divorce certificate that is not
            sanctioned by an Iranian court would automatically be void in Iran, meaning that the
            divorce would not be recognized under Iranian law. Therefore, in Iran, an Iranian woman
            would still be considered to be married to her husband.

            In order to avoid any difficulties in Iran related to a Canadian divorce, women should
            consult both a Canadian and an Iranian lawyer before travelling to Iran.

            For more information, consult our Marriage Overseas FAQ and our publication entitled Her
            Own Way: A Woman\'s Safe-Travel Guide.
            Custody of children

            Under Iranian law, children of divorced parents--even if they were born in Canada--are
            under the sole custody of their father, regardless of what a Canadian court may decide.
            Therefore, if such children are travelling with their mother in Iran, they may encounter
            great difficulty in returning to Canada. Women in such situations should consult both a
            Canadian and an Iranian lawyer before travelling to Iran.

            In the case of divorce or of the husband\'s death, an Iranian man\'s foreign-born wife
            may renounce her Iranian citizenship. However, the couple\'s children will irrevocably
            be Iranian citizens, and will have to enter and leave Iran with an Iranian passport.

            Guardianship of children under the age of seven usually goes to the mother and is
            automatically transferred to the father when the child turns seven. In rare cases,
            Iranian courts may grant legal custody to the paternal grandfather or to the mother if a
            court determines that the father is unsuitable to raise his children. Women can only
            gain custody under these circumstances if they hold Iranian citizenship and are
            residents of Iran.

            Even if a woman is granted custody of her children, children under the age of 18 still
            need permission from their paternal grandfather or the court to leave the country. Such
            permission is also required for other activities involving legal decisions, such as
            applying for a passport.
            Canadian children of Iranian fathers

            Canadian children whose father is an Iranian national face difficulties while in Iran.
            Under Iranian law, children of a male Iranian national, including Canadian-Iranian
            nationals, are in the sole custody of their father. Children require their father\'s
            permission to leave Iran.

            Iran is not a signatory to the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International
            Child Abduction.
            Money

            The currency is the Iranian rial (IRR). The economy is exclusively cash-based. Credit
            cards and traveller\'s cheques are not accepted in Iran. Automated banking machines
            exist only for local banking by Iranians. Bring sufficient cash, preferably in U.S.
            dollars, to cover all expenses. Only crisp U.S. banknotes are accepted.

            It is strictly prohibited to take antiquities, archaeological finds or antique carpets
            out of Iraq, in accordance with the Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property
            in the Event of Armed Conflict and its first protocol.
            Dual citizenship

            Dual citizenship is not legally recognized, which may limit the ability of Canadian
            officials to provide consular services. You should travel using your Canadian passport
            and present yourself as Canadian to foreign authorities at all times. See Travelling as
            a dual citizen for more information.
            Custody

            According to Iraqi law, the child of a male Iraqi national is considered an Iraqi
            national. Even if the name of the child is written in the mother\'s foreign passport,
            Iraqi authorities may consider the child an Iraqi national and the child will require
            the father\'s permission to travel.

            Religious and social traditions

            Dress conservatively, behave discreetly, and respect religious and social traditions to

            Use common sense and discretion in dress and behaviour, particularly in Jerusalem, the
            West Bank and the Gaza Strip. People feel strongly about their customs and beliefs.
            Assaults on visitors who are travelling in cars or immodestly dressed have occurred in
            Jerusalem\'s Old City and ultra-Orthodox Jewish neighbourhoods on the Sabbath (Friday
            nights and Saturdays).

            During periods of religious holidays, such as Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur, Ramadan and
            Pesach (Passover), stay informed of the security situation, follow the advice of
            authorities, respect local customs, and monitor local news reports for changes to
            checkpoint and border-crossing hours of operation.
            Money

            A special permit-issued only to residents and members of public organizations-is
            necessary to have access to Rome city centre by car. Similar restrictions are in place
            in most city centres. Take note of street signage and abide by the Zona a Traffico
            Limitato (limited traffic zone restriction), often abbreviated as "ZTL". In the summer,

            Laws

            Foreign visitors are required to carry their passport or residency (zairyu) card at all
            times.

            Japanese regulations require that visiting foreign nationals provide detailed
            information when checking in at hotels, inns or other lodging facilities. The purpose of
            registration is to assist authorities to prevent infectious diseases and terrorism. The
            required information includes your name, address, occupation, nationality and passport
            number. Foreigners must also allow their passports to be photocopied.

            Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are strict. Convicted
            offenders can expect jail sentences and fines. In most drug cases, suspects are denied
            oral or written communication with anyone other than their lawyer or a Canadian consular
            representative. Those arrested, even for a minor offence, may be held in detention for
            weeks or months during the investigation and legal proceedings.

            You must possess an International Driving Permit and obtain Japanese insurance to drive
            in Japan.

            There is zero tolerance for driving under the influence of alcohol. Penalties are

            incarceration.

            You can bring a one-month supply of prescription medication or a two-month supply of
            non-prescription medication into Japan providing the medication does not contain
            narcotics (including codeine). The importation of certain over-the-counter and
            prescription medications used to relieve sinus and allergy symptoms is banned.

            Prescribed medication must be accompanied by the doctor\'s prescription stating the
            patient\'s full name, address, reason for use and dosage. The bearer of the medication
            may be requested to present a detailed listing of the contents of the medication. If you
            wish to bring in larger supplies of medication or bring in prescription medication that
            contains narcotics, you must apply in advance for import certification. Application
            should be made several months prior to arrival. Consult the Japanese Ministry of Health,
            Labour and Welfare for more information.

            reviewed before being signed. There have been reports that some contracts have been
            modified after the fact. Ensure all terms and conditions of employment are clearly
            stated before accepting an offer and ensure that you meet all the necessary
            requirements. The Korean government investigates the use of fraudulent documents,
            university degrees and ESL certificates. Penalties for using fraudulent documents
            include arrest, deportation and restrictions on re-entry. Be aware that written
            contracts are not binding documents. Verbal agreements often take precedence over
            written agreements. Consult our publication entitled Teaching English in Korea for more
            information.
            Money

            The currency is the won (KRW). Traveller\'s cheques are accepted at all chartered banks
            (Eunhaeng in Korean). U.S. dollar traveller\'s cheques are recommended for the best
            exchange rate. Some major banks have automated banking machines (ABMs) that accept
            international debit or credit cards. The amount allowed per withdrawal may be quite low,
            rendering the service charge disproportionately high. Most ABMs that can be used to draw
            money from Canadian bank accounts offer English instructions. Major foreign credit cards
            (Visa, MasterCard and American Express) are widely accepted by hotels and other tourist
            facilities and are generally regarded as safe to use.

            When transferring funds from Korea to Canada, a local bank will place a stamp in your
            passport stating how much was transferred, in keeping with Korea\'s Foreign Currency
            Control Act. If you are working in Korea and paying Korean income tax, you can transfer
            your entire income based on your tax payment certificate.

            offenders can expect jail sentences and heavy fines.

            Photography of military or police installations, vehicles and personnel is prohibited.
            Homosexuality

            Homosexuality is not widely accepted in Kosovo.
            Driving laws

            An International Driving Permit is recommended. Always carry identification and vehicle
            registration papers. Third-party automobile insurance is mandatory and can be purchased
            upon entry into Kosovo.

            Drivers of vehicles bearing foreign licence plates must pay for compulsory third-party
            Green Card insurance.

            Road tolls must be paid in local currency. Posted speed limits are strictly enforced.
            Money

            The currency used throughout Kosovo is the euro (EUR). The economy is largely
            cash-based. Automated banking machines (ABMs) are available in urban centres.

            Suspects as well as witnesses to incidents may be held for lengthy periods without
            access to legal counsel or consular officials. If access is granted, it may be severely
            limited by the Kuwaiti authorities. Authorities may withhold the passport of an
            individual involved in legal processes, pending resolution of the case. This could
            result in the delay of a planned departure.
            Illegal activities

            Criticism of the Emir is not permitted by Kuwaiti authorities.

            Religious proselytizing is not permitted.

            Common-law relationships, homosexual relations, adultery and prostitution are illegal
            and are subject to severe punishment.

            Penalties for possession, use and trafficking of illegal drugs are strict. Convicted
            offenders can expect heavy fines, lengthy jail sentences or even the death penalty. The
            possession of drugs, even a very small amount, could result in arrest and imprisonment.

            Possession and consumption of alcohol is illegal in Kuwait. Alcohol cannot be legally
            purchased or imported into Kuwait, and the penalties associated with the possession of
            alcohol include heavy fines, imprisonment or deportation.

            There is a zero tolerance policy regarding drinking and driving. Consequences include
            heavy fines, imprisonment or deportation.

            Importation and consumption of pork products is illegal.

            It is illegal to possess pornographic material.

            Photography of government buildings and military or industrial sites, particularly oil
            fields, is forbidden. Do not photograph people without their permission.
            Fraudulent practices

            Fraudulent practices, for example, writing cheques without sufficient funds and
            non-payment of bills, are regarded as extremely serious offences and may result in
            imprisonment and fines. Temporary release pending legal action may be granted in minor
            cases if the passport of the accused and the passport of the guarantor are surrendered
            to the authorities.
            Dress and behaviour

            Common sense and discretion should be exercised in dress and behaviour. Men and women
            should dress conservatively. Men must wear pants and a shirt in public. It is uncommon
            for Western women to cover their head in Kuwait. Dresses and skirts are permitted,
            provided they cover the shoulders and knees. Shorts and short skirts are considered
            inappropriate.

            Exercise particular care in your behaviour with others, especially officials, to avoid
            offending local sensitivities. Verbal insults and obscene gestures may be considered a
            criminal act and, if found guilty, you could face deportation, fines and/or a prison
            sentence.

            Avoid physical contact, such as holding hands, in public.
            Dual citizenship

            Dual citizenship is not legally recognized, which may limit the ability of Canadian
            officials to provide consular services. You should travel using your Canadian passport
            and present yourself as Canadian to foreign authorities at all times. See Travelling as
            a dual citizen for more information.
            Child custody

            Child custody decisions are based on Islamic law. It is extremely difficult for a
            Canadian woman, even if she is a Muslim, to obtain custody of her children through
            Kuwaiti courts. Regardless of their parents\' marital status, minor children with a
            Kuwaiti father may not leave Kuwait without his permission.
            Money

            The currency, the Kuwaiti dinar (KWD), is readily convertible to U.S. dollars. Credit
            cards and U.S. dollar traveller\'s cheques are widely accepted, and automated banking
            machines are available nationwide.

            Homosexual activity is legal but not widely accepted by Kyrgyz society.

            Photography of military installations or government buildings may result in a penalty.
            Seek permission from local authorities before taking such photographs.
            Religion

            Although the Kyrgyz Republic is a secular country, Islamic practices and beliefs are
            closely adhered to, particularly in rural areas. Dress conservatively, behave discreetly
            and respect religious and social traditions to avoid offending local sensitivities.
            Dual citizenship

            Dual citizenship is not legally recognized, which may limit the ability of Canadian

            a dual citizen for more information.
            Money

            The currency is the Kyrgyzstani som. The economy is primarily cash-based. Canadian
            currency and traveller\'s cheques are not widely accepted. Declare foreign currency upon
            entry; you cannot leave with more foreign money than you brought in. Convert Kyrgyzstani
            soms into euros or U.S. dollars before leaving the country, as you will not be able to
            do so after departure. Automated banking machines are widely available in Bishkek but
            may be limited in rural areas. Credit cards are accepted in major hotels, some
            restaurants and most banks. Due to the potential for fraud and other criminal activity,
            use credit cards with caution. Leave copies of your card numbers with a family member,
            in case of emergency.

            Non-marital sexual relationships between foreigners and Laotian citizens are against the
            law, as are various forms of cohabitation with Laotian nationals. Convictions for such
            offences can lead to prison sentences and large fines. Improper registration of a
            relationship to a Laotian national can lead to similar penalties. Permission for
            marriage or engagement to a Laotian citizen must be submitted in a formal application to
            Laotian authorities.

            You can be fined for not carrying proper identification, such as your passport, at all
            times, and for not having an entry stamp in your passport.

            Photography of government buildings and vehicles, as well as bridges, airfields, and
            military installations or personnel, is prohibited. Violators may be arrested and their
            equipment, seized.

            Laos is tolerant of a diversity of religions. However, religious proselytizing or
            distributing of religious material is strictly prohibited. Violators may be arrested or
            deported.

            An International Driving Permit is recommended.
            Culture

            Public displays of affection, such as kissing, whether between opposite or same-sex
            couples, are not considered proper or polite.

            Consult the Canadian Trade Commissioner Service if you intend to do business in Laos.
            Money

            The currency is the kip (LAK). It is not easily obtained or exchanged outside of Laos.
            U.S. dollars and Thai baht are widely accepted. There are very few automated banking
            machines in Laos that accept foreign cards, and those that do are often out of order.
            Major credit cards are accepted at some international hotels and tourist establishments.
            Cash advances can be obtained from some banks, although the bank commissions are high.
            Traveller\'s cheques can be cashed at most banks in Vientiane and other major towns.

            Canadian and Latvian authorities.
            Illegal drugs

            Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are strict. Convicted
            offenders can expect jail sentences or heavy fines.
            Road travel

            A Canadian driver\'s licence is valid in Latvia for one year. An International Driving
            Permit is recommended.

            The use of cell telephones while driving is prohibited, unless they are fitted with a
            hands-free device.

            Headlights must be on at all times and the use of seat belts is mandatory.

            Vehicles should be equipped for severe conditions and must be fitted with winter tires
            between December 1 and March 1. All vehicles must have a first-aid kit and emergency
            travel equipment (e.g. warning triangle, fire extinguisher).

            Penalties for drinking and driving are strict. The legal blood alcohol limit is 0.02 for
            drivers with less than two years of driving experience and 0.05 for others. Convicted
            offenders can expect heavy fines or jail sentences.
            Exports

            Exportation of religious materials and antiquities is subject to strict customs
            regulations. Contact the Embassy of the Republic of Latvia for specific information
            regarding customs requirements.
            Money

            The currency of Latvia is the Euro.

            Foreign currency is easily exchanged. While becoming increasingly uncommon, traveller\'s
            cheques can be cashed at banks for a fee.

            Credit cards (primarily Visa and MasterCard) are widely accepted in Riga and other major
            centres. Automated banking machines are widely available, and most will accept Canadian
            bank cards and major credit cards.

            When crossing one of the external border control points of the European Union, you must
            make a declaration to customs upon entry or exit if you have at least â‚¬10,000, or the
            equivalent in other currencies. The sum can be in cash, cheque, money order,
            traveller\'s cheque or any other convertible asset. This does not apply if you are
            travelling within the European Union or in transit to a non-EU country. For more

            Illegal or restricted activities

            It is prohibited to photograph or videotape government buildings or military personnel,
            equipment and installations. Taking photographs in areas with a Hezbollah presence has
            led to the detention and questioning of Canadians in the past. In such situations,
            Canadian officials may face delays and obstacles in providing assistance.

            Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are strict. Convicted
            offenders can expect jail sentences and heavy fines. Individuals charged with drug
            offences can expect to remain in jail and to be denied bail while judicial authorities
            prepare their case for prosecution. This process may take months or years.

            Homosexual activity is illegal.
            Dual citizenship

            Dual citizenship is not legally recognized, which may limit the ability of Canadian
            officials to provide you with consular services. You should travel using your Canadian
            passport and present yourself as Canadian to foreign authorities at all times. Canadians
            of Lebanese descent carrying Lebanese identification documents will be treated as
            Lebanese nationals by security officials.

            See Travelling as a dual citizen for more information.
            Child custody

            In cases where one or more family members hold Lebanese citizenship, parents should
            consider the risks before their children travel to Lebanon. At the request of family
            members, Lebanese authorities can prevent children from leaving Lebanon (a procedure
            known as a "stop order," which husbands can also apply to wives). Canadian children who
            are registered as Lebanese citizens will be treated as Lebanese nationals. Lebanon is
            not a signatory to the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child
            Abduction, and Canadian custody documents are not recognized in Lebanon.
            Dress and behaviour

            The dress code in Lebanon is more relaxed than in most countries in the Middle East.
            However, you should dress conservatively, behave discreetly and respect religious and
            social traditions to avoid offending local sensitivities.

            Sleeveless garments and shorts may be acceptable at most locations but should be avoided
            when visiting sites of religious significance, such as churches and mosques, and when
            travelling in conservative areas of the country.
            Money

            The currency is the Lebanese pound (LBP). Most establishments will accept payment in
            U.S. dollars but may return change in LBP. Credit cards are widely accepted in hotels,
            restaurants and shops. Traveller\'s cheques are not accepted and will not be changed by
            local financial institutions.

            Automated banking machines (ABMs) are widely available in Lebanon. Use ABMs located
            inside, or adjacent to, bank branches for greater security and to be able to retrieve a
            lost card faster.

            only at major tourist establishments and banks. Currency is readily available through
            automated banking machines (ABMs).

            The currency is the Liberian dollar (LRD). The economy is cash-based. U.S. dollars are
            widely accepted and easily converted into local currency. Traveller\'s cheques, credit
            and debit cards are not accepted anywhere in Liberia. Automated banking machines (ABMs)
            are unavailable. You are advised to carry sufficient funds in U.S. dollars to cover

            citizen for more information.
            Child custody

            Child custody decisions are based on Islamic law. It is extremely difficult for a
            Canadian woman, even if she is a Muslim, to obtain custody of her children through a
            court decision, unless she decides to stay in Libya. Regardless of parental marital
            status, children of Libyan fathers acquire Libyan citizenship at birth, and must enter
            and leave Libya on Libyan passports. Canadian mothers require their husband\'s
            permission to take their Libyan children outside the country.
            Culture

            Islamic practices and beliefs are closely adhered to in the country\'s customs, laws and
            regulations. Dress conservatively, behave discreetly, and respect religious and social
            traditions to avoid offending local sensitivities.

            Officials may confiscate your passport if you are involved in a business dispute.
            Money

            The economy is primarily cash-based. The currency, the Libyan dinar (LYD), is

            francs and Tunisian dinars can be converted into Libyan dinars. U.S. dollars can be
            exchanged at official exchange counters or banks. Adhere to the rules regarding currency

            Although France recognizes dual citizenship, dual citizens are considered French
            citizens and are subject to French laws. See Travelling as a dual citizen for more
            information.
            Dress and behaviour

            The majority of the population is Muslim. Dress conservatively, behave discreetly, and
            respect religious and social traditions to avoid offending local sensitivities.
            Money

            The currency is the Euro (EUR). Automated Banking machines are increasing in numbers and
            are common in Mamoudzou and Petite-Terre.

        <item>Illegal activities

            Penalties for breaking the law in Mexico can be more severe than in Canada, even for
            similar offences.

            Penalties for drug offences are very strict, and convicted offenders can expect lengthy
            jail sentences.

            You should avoid any involvement with illegal substances or those who deal with them.
            You should also avoid borrowing a vehicle or picking up hitchhikers; drivers are legally
            responsible for their vehicle\'s contents, as well as for the legal status of passengers
            and the items carried by passengers.

            The Mexican government strictly enforces its laws concerning possession, entry, and
            trafficking of firearms. Anyone (including foreign armed forces personnel) entering
            Mexico with a firearm or ammunition without prior written authorization from Mexican
            authorities is subject to imprisonment. It is also illegal to enter the country with
            certain types of knives. You can obtain a complete list of forbidden items and import
            permit requirements from the Embassy of Mexico in Canada.

            It is illegal to drink alcoholic beverages in non-designated public areas. The minimum
            age at which people are legally allowed to purchase or consume alcoholic beverages is 18
            years old.

            Participation in political activities (such as demonstrations) by foreigners is
            prohibited and should be avoided, as it may result in detention, deportation, or the
            denial of future entry into Mexico.

            It is illegal to possess archaeological artefacts or to export such items from Mexico.
            Dual citizenship

            Dual citizenship status may limit the ability of Canadian officials to provide consular
            services. See Dual citizenship for more information.
            Customs

            Tourists are allowed to bring in their personal effects duty-free. Failure to declare
            personal effects will result in their confiscation and a fine. Mexican customs provides
            information regarding entry into Mexico by air or land. When carrying more than
            US$10,000 or its equivalent in other currencies, cash, cheques, money orders, or any
            other monetary instrument, you must declare the amount exceeding US$10,000. Failure to
            make this declaration is against Mexican law and often results in detention.

            If you wish to donate goods, contact the Embassy of Mexico in Canada before sending or
            importing goods to Mexico in order to fulfill the importation permit requirements.
            Identity documents

            Mexican authorities require that the names indicated on your identity documents
            (generally your passport) be identical to those appearing on your birth certificate
            before issuing official documents, such as marriage certificates, immigration documents
            or Mexican passports. Many Canadians have encountered significant difficulties due to
            this requirement, as middle names are often left off Canadian identity documents. If you
            plan on residing in Mexico or dealing with Mexican Civil Registry, you should obtain a
            Canadian passport that will meet Mexican requirements.
            Vehicles and Boats

            Canadian driver\'s licences are valid in Mexico. The police sometimes ask foreigners to
            show identification and proof of their legal status in Mexico. You should always carry
            valid photo identification, your passport, visa, and other documents. Leave a certified
            copy of your vehicle registration with relatives or friends in Canada.

            a) Rentals

            The contract for a rental vehicle must be in the traveller\'s name and include a full
            description of the vehicle.

            b) Company-owned vehicles

            You must produce proof of employment and of the vehicle\'s ownership by the company.

            c) Importation

            Mexico has very strict rules regarding the entry of foreign vehicles and boats. Do not
            enter Mexico without having obtained the proper importation permit and car/boat
            insurance. Without a permit, you may be fined and have your vehicle seized. Contact the
            Embassy or a consulate of Mexico in Canada to verify the latest regulations and
            requirements regarding vehicle and boat importation. Complete information is available
            from Aduana MÃ©xico.

            Motor vehicles

            If you wish to travel beyond the border zone (20 to 30 kilometres from the U.S. border)
            with your car, you must obtain a Temporary Vehicle Importation Permit (Solicitud de
            importaciÃ³n temporal de vehÃ­culos). The permit can only be obtained at the port of
            entry or online at Aduana MÃ©xico before crossing the border into Mexico.

            You are only allowed to bring one vehicle into the country at a time. Those travelling
            with a recreational vehicle are not entitled to tow a second vehicle unless it is
            registered in the name of an accompanying traveller. The second vehicle should not
            exceed the weight limit of 3.5 tons. It is the owner\'s responsibility to obtain the
            permit through the Banco Nacional del EjÃ©rcito, Fuerza AÃ©rea y Armada or Aduana
            MÃ©xico 10 to 180 days before departure. Permits can also be obtained at one of the
            Mexican consulates located in Austin, Dallas, Houston, Los Angeles, Sacramento, San
            Bernardino, Albuquerque, Denver, and Phoenix, or at a customs office located along the
            U.S.-Mexico border or, in some cases, within an authorized border zone. Watch for signs
            indicating customs checkpoints and Banjercito Bank locations (where permits can be
            issued and cancelled).

            If you stay beyond the date indicated on the Temporary Vehicle Importation Permit, your
            vehicle may be seized.

            When leaving Mexico, you must return your Temporary Vehicle Importation Permit in
            person, along with the vehicle with which you entered the country, to any customs office
            at the border so that the permit can be cancelled. Keep a copy of the cancellation
            documents. Neither the Embassy of Canada in Mexico City nor the Embassy of Mexico in
            Ottawa can return these permits on behalf of Canadian citizens. It is not permissible to
            mail your permit to the border point. As long as the permit remains in effect, you will
            be unable to import another vehicle into Mexico. You may be able to cancel the permit on
            a future visit to Mexico if you enter at the same border point with the same vehicle;
            however, a fine may be imposed.

            In cases where the permit holder cannot exit the country with the vehicle (for example,
            in case of death or sickness), the person driving the car out of Mexico must be a
            foreigner with a valid tourist card and have documentation to prove the relationship
            with the car owner, such as a marriage or birth certificate.

            Boats

            It is the owner\'s responsibility to obtain the importation permit through the Banco
            Nacional del EjÃ©rcito, Fuerza AÃ©rea y Armada or Aduana MÃ©xico 7 to 60 days before
            departure. Permits can also be obtained at one of the Mexican consulates located in
            Austin, Dallas, Houston, Los Angeles, Sacramento, San Bernardino, Albuquerque, Denver,
            and Phoenix.

            Further information and online application forms can be found at Banco Nacional del
            EjÃ©rcito, Fuerza AÃ©rea y Armada (available in English and French).

            d) Purchasing/selling

            Foreigners who wish to purchase a car in Mexico must hold either temporary or permanent
            residency in Mexico, be able to pay vehicle taxes, and obtain Mexican licence plates. If
            you are interested in buying a car, consult local authorities.

            It is illegal to sell your imported vehicle in Mexico. If you do, your vehicle may be
            seized and you may be subject to a fine and deportation.
            Insurance

            Canadian automobile insurance is not recognized in Mexico. You must obtain additional
            insurance at the Mexican border. Full coverage is recommended, including coverage for
            legal assistance. Automobile insurance is much more expensive in Mexico than in Canada.
            Many local drivers do not have any form of car insurance.

            For more information on Mexican driver\'s permits, vehicle inspection, road tax, or
            mandatory insurance, please contact the SECTUR at 1-866-640-0597 (toll free from
            Canada).
            Accidents and fines

            In case of an accident or theft of your vehicle, you should immediately obtain a police
            report from the nearest police station (Ministerio PÃºblico) and present it to the
            Mexico City customs office (Aduanas) in order to cancel the Temporary Vehicle
            Importation Permit no later than five days after the incident. If you are involved in a
            traffic accident, you may face serious legal problems, including imprisonment. You could
            be taken into custody until responsibility for the accident is determined and all
            penalties are paid. If you do not have Mexican liability insurance, you could be
            prevented from leaving the country until all parties agree that adequate financial
            satisfaction has been received. Depending on the extent of injuries or damages, drivers
            may face criminal charges. Motor vehicle insurance is considered invalid in Mexico if
            the driver is found to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs at the time of the
            accident, or if the driver has no valid driver\'s licence.

            If you receive a fine for a driving infraction in certain parts of the country, the
            issuing police officer is obligated by law to retain your driver\'s license or
            registration until the fine is paid. Expect delays in recovering the document.
            Driving restrictions

            In order to reduce air pollution, time and day restrictions are imposed on driving in
            Mexico City as well as other regions of the country. Based on licence plate numbers,
            there is at least one day each week and one Saturday per month when driving is
            forbidden. This applies equally to permanent, temporary, and foreign plates. These
            regulations are strictly enforced. Offenders face heavy fines and temporary confiscation
            of their vehicle.

            A supplementary driving restriction has been implemented in Mexico City. Vehicles
            without plates from the State of Mexico (Estado de MÃ©xico) or the Federal District (DF)
            are not allowed to circulate from Monday to Friday from 5 a.m. to 11 a.m. For more
            information, consult the Mexican Ministry of the Environment (in Spanish). An exemption
            to this driving restriction may be obtained for cars with foreign plates by requesting a
            permit, the Pase TurÃ­stico (tourist pass), which is granted either for two periods of
            seven days or one period of 14 days in a six-month period. In order to obtain the
            tourist pass, you must register at Pase TurÃ­stico (in Spanish).
            Real estate

            You may acquire real estate in Mexico. However, you should consult a lawyer, as real
            estate transactions, laws, and practices can be complex and differ considerably from
            those in Canada. Choose your own lawyer or notary and avoid hiring the one recommended
            by the seller. Mexican real estate agents are not licensed or regulated.

            Research potential property purchases carefully, as irregularities occur, most
            frequently title challenges, which may result in litigation and possible eviction.
            Trusts do not guarantee that the purchase is legitimate. Visit the local Property
            Registry (Registro de Propiedad) and ask to see the property registry to confirm the
            name of the last owner and the fact that the property is free of any mortgage.
            Time-share agreements

            Reports of problems with time-share arrangements (including cancellation of contracts
            and fraudulent sales) have increased. Be prepared for the possibility of being
            approached by persistent time-share representatives on the street, as well as at the
            airport or on the way to your hotel. Be prepared for common pressure tactics, such as
            being told that promotions are only valid for that day and being offered free tours,
            meals, gifts, or alcoholic beverages.

            Before purchasing a time-share, gather as much information as possible, research the
            properties, and even get a legal opinion. If you do decide to buy, be sure to carefully
            review the contract. Anything not included in the contract will not be honoured. Only
            provide your credit card if you are certain you wish to make the purchase.

            Cancellation of contracts: Time-share companies have requested that their clients sign a
            waiver that prevents them from cancelling the contract. Such practices are illegal.
            Mexican law stipulates that consumers are legally entitled to cancel a time-share
            contract without penalty; however, the cancellation must be done within five working
            days starting from the day following the original date of purchase. Cancellations of
            contracts must be done in writing and must be presented directly to the time-share
            company. Keep copies of all correspondence.

            Fraudulent sale of time-shares: Companies and individuals may approach you claiming to
            have a buyer for your time-share and asking you to pay taxes beforehand. After payment
            of the so-called "taxes", Canadians have discovered that their time-share was never
            sold. If you experience any difficulties with a time-share company, you should
            immediately contact the Mexican Consumer Protection Agency, the ProcuradurÃ­a Federal
            del Consumidor (PROFECO).
            Renting

            Rental agreements between two individuals in Mexico are considered a private matter and
            are not regulated by the government. Should you encounter difficulties with a rental
            agreement and wish to take legal action, you will be required to obtain the services of
            a Mexican lawyer.
            Money

            The currency is the Mexican peso (MXN/MXV). Automated banking machine services are
            available throughout the country. Canadian debit and credit cards are widely accepted;
            however, Canadian currency and traveller\'s cheques are not. Some Canadians have
            recently reported that they were unable to withdraw cash from automated banking machines
            using Canadian debit cards. Consult with your bank before you travel.

            There is a limit to the amount of U.S. dollars that both residents and foreigners can
            exchange in Mexico, depending on your immigration status in Mexico. Although the rule
            does not apply to Canadian dollars, some financial institutions, hotels, and currency
            exchange bureaus are not making the distinction.

            31). Winter tires are mandatory during winter months. You must carry a fire
            extinguisher, a first aid kit and a warning triangle in your car. The use of a cellular
            telephone while driving is prohibited, unless it is fitted with a hands-free device.
            Import/export

            Strict regulations are in place regarding the export of antiques, artwork and items of
            historical Moldovan significance. You must seek the approval from the Moldovan
            Department of Monuments for the export of such material. Proof of the approval may be
            requested at the point of departure. Heavy fines or charges may be imposed if you fail
            to provide proof of approval to export.
            Money

            The currency is the Moldovan lei (MDL).

            An International Driving Permit is recommended. Always carry identification and vehicle
            registration papers.

            Drivers of vehicles bearing foreign licence plates must pay insurance. Road tolls must
            be paid in local currency. Montenegrin Government introduced an eco-tax for using road
            vehicles. Foreign nationals must pay the tax when entering Montenegro by car. The fee is
            determined according to the make and size of the vehicle. The eco-sticker obtained upon
            payment of the tax is valid for one year and must be displayed on the inside of the
            front windscreen in the upper right hand corner.

            Posted speed limits are strictly enforced. There have been incidents where police target
            vehicles with foreign plates, often demanding immediate cash payment for alleged traffic
            violations. If you are stopped, request a full explanation and, if an explanation is not
            forthcoming, ask permission to speak to the Embassy of Canada in Belgrade.

            discretion.


            Money

            The currency of Montenegro is the euro (EUR).

            The economy is largely cash-based. Banking facilities are limited, but automated banking
            machines (ABMs) are spreading rapidly throughout the country and provide the easiest
            access to local currency. More and more hotels, restaurants and shops accept credit
            cards.

            When crossing one of the external border control points of the European Union (EU), you
            must make a declaration to customs upon entry or exit if you have at least â‚¬10,000 or
            the equivalent in other currencies. For Montenegro, this amount is restricted to
            â‚¬2,000. The sum can be in cash, cheques, money orders, traveller\'s cheques or any
            other convertible assets. This does not apply if you are travelling within the EU or in
            transit to a non-EU country. For more information on the EU legislation and links to EU
            countries\' sites, visit the web page of the European Commission on cash controls.

            access to legal counsel or consular officials. If access is granted, it may be severely
            limited by the Omani authorities. Authorities may withhold the passport of an individual
            involved in a legal process, pending resolution of the case. This could result in the
            delay of a planned departure.
            Dress and behaviour

            The country\'s customs, laws and regulations adhere closely to Islamic practices and
            beliefs. Dress conservatively, behave discreetly and respect religious and social
            traditions to avoid offending local sensitivities.

            Exercise particular care in your behaviour with others, especially officials, to avoid
            offending local sensitivities. Verbal insults and obscene gestures may be considered a
            criminal act and, if found guilty, you could face deportation, fines and/or a prison
            sentence.
            Money

            The currency is the Omani rial (OMR). Credit cards and U.S. dollar traveller\'s cheques
            are widely accepted.

            Illegal or restricted activities

            Religious proselytizing is not permitted.

            The possession and consumption of alcohol is prohibited. Transgressions could be
            punished by detention or other penalties. Penalties for illegal drug possession, use, or

            Ask permission before taking photographs of local residents.
            Dual citizenship

            Dual citizenship is not legally recognized, which may limit the ability of Canadian
            officials to provide consular services. You should travel using your Canadian passport
            and present yourself as Canadian to foreign authorities at all times.

            If you were born in Pakistan, or if your father was born in Pakistan, you should confirm
            your citizenship status with the High Commission of Pakistan in Ottawa as you could be
            considered a Pakistani citizen while on Pakistani soil.

            See Travelling as a dual citizen for more information.
            Dress and behaviour

            The country\'s customs, laws and regulations adhere closely to Islamic practices and
            beliefs. Sharia law has been adopted in the Swat Valley. Dress conservatively, behave
            discreetly, and respect religious and social traditions to avoid offending local
            sensitivities.

            Shorts are considered inappropriate attire for both men and women, particularly in
            remote locations. Women should consider carrying a headscarf with them at all times
            while travelling in Pakistan. Consult our publication entitled Her Own Way: A Woman\'s
            Safe-Travel Guide for travel safety information specifically aimed at Canadian women.
            Money

            The currency is the Pakistani rupee (PKR). The economy mainly operates on a cash-only
            basis. Credit cards and traveller\'s cheques are accepted by a few establishments in
            larger cities. Currency can be exchanged at all international airports. Automated
            banking machines are available.

        <item>Illegal drugs

            Penalties for use, possession or trafficking of illegal drugs in Panama are very strict.
            Offenders can expect heavy fines and/or long jail sentences in difficult prison
            conditions.
            Laws

            Panamanian law requires all individuals to carry official identification documents at
            all times. Failure to produce identification upon request may result in travellers being
            taken to jail and charged a fine.

            Under the Panamanian penal code, knowingly infecting others with a sexually transmitted
            disease is a crime.

            Although homosexual activity is not illegal, discretion is highly recommended in public
            places since homosexuality is not socially acceptable in all areas.

            There may be curfews for minors (under 18 years old) in Panama City. Minors circulating
            alone late at night in Panama City may be detained by police until their parents can be
            contacted if the police deem that they are involved in suspicious activities. Fines may
            be imposed.

            Ask permission before taking photographs of individuals, particularly of children and
            women. When taking pictures of indigenous persons, it is normal to be asked to pay a
            small fee.

            You can use their provincial driver\'s licence in Panama for a period of up to 90 days,
            even though you are permitted to stay in Panama for up to 180 days without a visa.

            Although vehicle insurance is compulsory, many Panamanians drive without it. In the
            event of an accident, call 104 to reach the police, and do not move the vehicle until
            you are advised to do so by a police officer.

            Panama\'s legal system is complex. Reporting a crime differs greatly from reporting a
            crime in Canada and may vary from province to province. Local authorities generally do
            not speak English or French; therefore, a translator and/or legal representation may be
            required.
            Real estate

            You should consult with a reputable real estate agent and/or a local real estate lawyer
            before purchasing property in Panama.
            Money

            The official currency in Panama is the Balboa (PAB), which is used interchangeably with
            the U.S. dollar (USD). Because of problems with counterfeit US$50 and US$100 bills,
            carry small denominations of U.S. dollars.

            widely accepted. U.S. dollars can be exchanged in every exchange agency (casa de cambio)
            and at most banks. Credit cards are accepted in most hotels, restaurants, and shops.
        </item>
        <item>Illegal drugs

            Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are strict. Convicted
            offenders can expect lengthy jail sentences, regardless of the amount of narcotics
            seized at arrest.

            Pack your luggage yourself and keep it with you at all times. Do not carry anything
            through customs for anybody else.

            Prison conditions in Peru are poor.
            Laws

            Foreigners are required to carry photo identification at all times. Be cautious when you
            carry your passport, especially in entertainment venues. A photocopy of your
            passport--specifically the information, visa and entry stamp pages--is generally
            acceptable. However, police may require that you produce the original. Failure to show
            identification could result in detention and police questioning at the nearest station
            where fingerprints would be taken.

            You should respect local customs and laws when visiting Peru\'s historical sites. Fines
            and other penalties may be imposed by Peruvian authorities for any actions considered to
            be disrespectful at historical and archaeological sites such as Machu Picchu,
            Saqsayhuaman, and Ollantaytambo.

            Peruvian law strictly prohibits the export of antiques and artefacts (huacos) from
            pre-colonial civilizations. Travellers who purchase reproductions of colonial or
            pre-colonial art should buy only from reputable dealers and should insist upon
            documentation from Peru\'s National Institute of Culture showing that the object is a
            reproduction and may be exported.

            The export of coca tea bags is prohibited and it is illegal to remove certain fauna and
            flora items from Peru.

            It is forbidden to photograph military installations.

            A foreign driver\'s license can be used only in Lima for 30 days after arrival. To drive
            outside of Lima or for an extended period, an international driving permit is mandatory.
            Money

            The currency is the Peruvian nuevo sol (PEN). The US dollar is widely accepted. Credit
            cards are widely accepted in Lima, but less so outside major cities. Travellers cheques
            are not widely accepted. In small towns, automated banking machines (ABMs) may not be
            readily available. ABMs in large cities may accept out-of-country bank cards and credit
            cards. You should inform your banking company of your travel prior to departing and
            confirm whether you will be able to use ABMs in Peru.

            Counterfeit currency in both nuevo sol and U.S. dollars is a growing and serious
            problem. Counterfeit bills are widely distributed, including by banks, casinos and local
            stores. Tourists should be aware of the security features of the currency they are using
            and be aware of scams involving switching legitimate bills with counterfeit.

        <item>Laws

            Attending any protest, demonstration or political rally may lead to detention and
            deportation.

            Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are strict. Convicted
            offenders can face life imprisonment for certain drug-related crimes.

            A lifetime sentence is also often imposed for rape.

            Conviction for "swindling" or "bad debts" can result in sentences of up to 20 years.

            Penalties for pedophile activity are strict. Under Philippine law, a child is defined as
            a person under the age of 18. An adult may be reported to the police if he or she is a)
            seen with an unrelated child of 12 years or younger, or who is 10 years or more his
            junior, or b) seen alone with an unrelated child inside the room of a house, hotel or
            other similar establishment, vehicle or other secluded location, and is believed to have
            the intention to sexually exploit said child.

            The import or export of more than 10,000 Philippine pesos (bills and coins only) must be
            authorized by the Central Bank of the Philippines.

            Photography of official buildings intended for publication is prohibited.

            Foreigners are required to carry identification. A photocopy of the identification page
            of your passport is acceptable.

            An International Driving Permit is recommended. However, you should apply for a local
            driving permit if you wish to drive in the Philippines for more than 90 days from the
            date of your arrival in the country.

            You may bring your own medicines, but only in quantities sufficient for the duration of
            your stay. Bring a letter from your physician if you are carrying prescription drugs,
            stating the dosage and the condition for which you are receiving treatment. If you are
            travelling onward to another country, a separate quantity of prescription drugs should
            be sealed and declared again before departing the Philippines.

            If you plan to get married in the Philippines, ensure that you are well informed
            regarding Philippine requirements. Consult the Embassy of Canada to the Philippines for
            more information.
            Money

            The currency is the Philippine peso (PHP). Credit cards are accepted in major
            establishments. U.S. dollar traveller\'s cheques can sometimes be exchanged in certain
            banks and hotels; verify with the issuing authority in Canada before purchasing them for
            use in the Philippines. Automated banking machines are available in larger cities.

            Language

            The official and commonly spoken language in Poland is Polish. Services in English can
            generally be found at hotels, restaurants and shops in major tourist locations. French
            is not commonly spoken in Poland. You may experience difficulties in obtaining services
            in English or French outside major tourist destinations. This is also true of many
            governmental services, including medical care, police services and public
            transportation.
            Driving laws

            An International Driving Permit is required.

            Credit cards and debit cards are accepted. Automated banking machines (ABMs) are
            available in all major cities and towns. Traveller\'s cheques are less common and often
            not accepted.

            When crossing one of the external border control points of the European Union (EU), you
            must make a declaration to Customs upon entry or exit if you have at least â‚¬10,000, or
            the equivalent in other currencies. The sum can be in cash, cheques, money orders,
            traveller\'s cheques or any other convertible assets. This does not apply if you are

            Illegal or restricted activities

            Religious proselytizing is not permitted.

            Avoid public displays of affection, including holding hands and kissing.

            Drunk driving, public intoxication and other alcohol-related offenses, possession and/or
            use or trafficking in illegal drugs are illegal in Qatar.

            Common-law relationships, adultery, prostitution and possession of pornographic material
            are illegal and are subject to severe punishment.

            The laws of Qatar prohibit sexual acts between individuals of the same sex. Other
            related offences include being in a same-sex marriage and promoting homosexuality.
            Convicted offenders can face up to life imprisonment or the death penalty. LGBT
            travellers should carefully consider the risks of travelling to Qatar. See Gay, lesbian,
            bisexual and transgender travel for more information.

            Do not drink alcohol outside licensed hotels.

            It is forbidden to photograph government buildings and military installations. Do not
            photograph people without their permission.
            Customs

            Do not import pork products, alcohol or pornographic material. Videos are subject to
            scrutiny and may be censored.
            Dual citizenship

            Dual citizenship is not legally recognized, which may limit the ability of Canadian
            officials to provide consular services. You should travel using your Canadian passport
            and present yourself as Canadian to foreign authorities at all times. See Travelling as
            a dual citizen for more information.
            Marriage

            If you marry a Qatari citizen, the Qatari government may inform you that you have lost
            your Canadian citizenship. Note, however, that governments do not have the authority to
            annul citizenships of other countries. If such an event occurs, contact the nearest
            Canadian government office as soon as possible. For more information, consult Marriage
            Overseas.
            Custody

            Children of a Qatari father automatically acquire Qatari citizenship at birth and must
            enter and leave the country on a Qatari passport. Child custody decisions are based on
            Islamic law. It is difficult for a Western woman, even a Muslim, to obtain custody of
            her children through the Qatari courts. Minor children of a Qatari-national father must
            have his permission to leave the country.
            Legal process

            Suspects and witnesses to incidents may be held for a few days without access to legal
            counsel or consular officials. If access is granted, it may be severely limited by the
            Qatari authorities. The Embassy of Canada to the State of Qatar is usually not notified
            by the authorities when a Canadian citizen is arrested. Authorities may withhold the
            passport of an individual involved in legal processes, including labour dispute, or
            issue a travel ban, pending resolution of the case. These processes can last up to
            several years.
            Dress and behaviour

            The country\'s customs, laws and regulations adhere closely to Islamic practices and
            beliefs. Exercise common sense and discretion in dress and behaviour, and dress
            conservatively. Western women do not usually cover their head. Western women may wear
            dresses and skirts, provided they cover the shoulders and knees; shorts, short skirts
            and tight and revealing clothing are considered inappropriate.

            Exercise particular care in your behaviour with others, especially officials, to avoid

            Illegal activities

            There are harsh penalties for engaging in sexual acts with a minor (the age of consent
            in Romania is 18). In addition, Canadians may be prosecuted at home for sexually
            exploiting children while abroad. Consult our publication Child Sex Tourism: It\'s a

            Road travel

            A Canadian driver\'s licence is valid in Romania for stays up to 90 days; a local
            driver\'s licence is required for longer stays. Residents must have a Romanian driver\'s
            licence. You must carry vehicle registration and proof of insurance.

            Headlights must be on at all times when driving, regardless of the time of day or

            The economy is primarily cash-based. You may exchange Euros in recognized
            establishments, such as exchange shops, banks and hotels. Carry crisp bills, as
            well-worn or used banknotes may not be accepted. Traveller\'s cheques are not widely
            accepted.

            Credit cards are widely accepted in major urban centres. Most retailers use personal
            identification number technology for credit cards. Automated banking machines are widely
            available in major cities and, increasingly, in smaller towns.

            When crossing one of the external border control points of the European Union (EU), you
            must make a declaration to customs upon entry or exit if you are carrying at least
            â‚¬10,000 or the equivalent in other currencies. The sum can be in cash, cheques, money

            Although homosexual activity is not illegal in Russia, a federal law has been passed
            that prohibits public actions that are described as promoting homosexuality and
            "non-traditional sexual relations". This law could render any homosexual and
            pro-homosexual statements punishable. Public actions (including dissemination of
            information, statements, displays or conspicuous behaviour) that contravene or appear to
            contravene this law may lead to arrest, the imposition of a fine and deportation.

            Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender travellers, as well as their friends and
            families, have been targets of harassment and violence.

            Taking photos of railways, bridges, dams, airports, train stations, the underground
            Metro system and all official buildings is prohibited. Incidents have occurred at
            marketplaces where Canadians have taken photos of market stalls and found themselves
            remanded to market police. Cameras, film and other equipment may be confiscated, and
            fines payable in cash on the spot may be imposed. Ask permission before taking
            photographs.
            Identification documents

            You may be fined or detained for failing to provide proper documentation to Russian
            authorities. Carry your original passport (photocopies are not acceptable), entry/exit
            visa and registered migration card at all times. Failure to provide identification
            documents could result in heavy fines or a jail sentence.
            Traffic police

            The traffic police can only stop motorists and impose fines for traffic violations.
            Although they can also conduct identity checks on pedestrians, they have no authority to
            impose fines. The same is true of police in the underground Metro systems. Only the
            special police of the Federal Migration Bureau have the authority to arrest, detain, and
            impose fines on improperly documented foreigners. If you are stopped in the street and
            requested to pay a fine, ask to see the officer\'s name and identification and to
            contact the Embassy of Canada in Moscow.
            Dual citizenship

            Although dual citizenship is not legally recognized in Russia, beginning August 3, 2014,
            Russian citizens residing in Russia who also possess a foreign citizenship or permanent
            residency status in another country must declare this citizenship or residency status to
            their local migration office. See the Federal Migration Service of the Russian
            Federation (in Russian only) for more details on this requirement and consequences of
            non-compliance.

            See Travelling as a dual citizen for more information.
            Importation / exportation

            Russia has very strict rules on the importation of medication: certain prescription and
            over-the-counter drugs that are common in Canada may be prohibited, and large quantities
            of any medicine will be scrutinized.

            The importation and use of electronic equipment are strictly controlled. Foreigners have
            faced charges of espionage for possessing improperly certified GPS (Global Positioning
            System) devices, such as those used for geological mapping.

            You must obtain a certificate from the Ministry of Culture to export items that appear
            old (prior to 1945) or that have cultural value. Customs officials may conduct thorough
            baggage searches and may arrest you if you do not have the necessary certificate.

            credit cards, travellers\' cheques and bank cards as methods of payment or to obtain
            cash. Traveller\'s cheques can be cashed only at a few locations in Moscow, such as
            American Express offices. Credit cards and traveller\'s cheques are not widely accepted
            outside Moscow and St. Petersburg. Automated banking machines (ABMs) are common in main

            Canadian women married to Saudi men and Canadians under 21 years of age with a Saudi
            father need the permission of the Saudi male head of the household to leave the country.
            Married women, no matter their husband\'s citizenship, require their husband\'s
            permission to leave the country, while all unmarried women, regardless of age, and
            unmarried men under the age of 21 require the permission of their father or male
            guardian to leave the country, irrespective of the father\'s or guardian\'s nationality.

            A Saudi man who wishes to marry a foreign woman is required by law to seek the
            permission of Saudi authorities. He must also sign a document that gives irrevocable
            permission to his foreign wife and the children born of their union to travel in and out
            of the country without restrictions. This law has been in effect since February 20,
            2008, and is not retroactive. Regardless of this law, the foreign spouse and their
            children may still have difficulty leaving Saudi Arabia whenever they wish.
            Legal process

            The Saudi judicial system is based on Sharia law. The legal process may be slow and
            cumbersome. Those suspected of and witnesses to offences may be held for lengthy periods
            without access to legal counsel or consular officials. If access is granted, it may be
            severely limited by Saudi authorities.
            Business

            Arabic is the only officially recognized language for business transactions.

            Examine all conditions carefully and ensure that you fully understand them prior to
            accepting a job offer or signing a contract. Include oral understandings in the
            contract.

            Obtain the services of an independent Saudi-based lawyer and ensure translation of all
            documents, especially the contract, in order to be fully aware of all conditions, limits
            and terms.

            Seek legal advice from a Canadian or Saudi lawyer before signing any contract. If in
            doubt, seek advice from a lawyer in Canada. A list of local lawyers is available from
            the Embassy of Canada in Riyadh.

            In case of a dispute, a Saudi complainant may prevent a foreigner from leaving the
            country until the dispute is settled.
            Money

            The currency is the Saudi riyal (SAR). Credit cards and traveller\'s cheques are widely
            accepted, especially in main cities.

        <item>Laws and illegal activities

            Driving under the influence of alcohol is illegal. Convicted offenders are subject to a
            jail sentence, a fine or both.

            Possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs may result in long jail sentences, heavy
            fines or both.

            It is prohibited to photograph government buildings, airports or other official
            facilities.

            Homosexual activity is a criminal offence and could result in a prison sentence of one

            Dress and behaviour

            Exercise common sense and discretion in dress and behaviour. Respect religious and
            social traditions to avoid offending local sensitivities.
            Border crossings

            Bribe requests from border officials have sparked violent incidents at Diama, one of the
            official land border crossings into Mauritania. Do not cross the Senegal River by
            private pirogue; to do so is illegal and dangerous.
            Customs formalities

            Some items, including auto parts, computers and computer parts, stereo equipment, tape
            players, tools, and video cameras and players, are subject to strict customs regulations
            and cannot be brought into the country without clearance by Senegalese authorities.
            Contact the Embassy of the Republic of Senegal for further information on customs
            requirements.
            Money

            The currency is the African Financial Community CFA franc (or XOF bank code).

            Avoid exchanging large quantities of CFA francs for foreign currency from other than
            reputable exchange bureaus.

            Automated banking machines are widespread and reliable in Dakar, although withdrawal
            limits may be quite low.

            Credit cards are rarely accepted except by major hotels, travel agencies and airline
            companies. Credit card cash advances can be obtained, but are time-consuming to
            complete.
        </item>
        <item>Canada and Serbia are signatories to the European Convention on the Transfer of
            Sentenced Persons. This enables a Canadian imprisoned in Serbia to request a transfer to
            a Canadian prison to complete a sentence. The transfer requires the agreement of both
            Canadian and Serbian authorities.
            Identification

            Carry adequate identification at all times. Keep a photocopy of your passport in case of
            loss or seizure.
            Illegal activities

            Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are strict. Convicted
            offenders can expect long jail sentences and heavy fines.

            unless authorized by the Ministry of Defence.
            Dual citizenship

            Canadians who are also citizens of Serbia are no longer subject to compulsory military
            service. Those who have not regulated their draft status should check with a Serbian
            embassy or consulate prior to travelling to ensure that their status has been resolved.
            See Travelling as a dual citizen for more information.
            Homosexuality

            While Serbian law forbids discrimination based on sexual orientation, homosexuality is
            not widely accepted by Serbian society. Visitors are advised to exercise discretion.
            Driving laws

            An International Driving Permit is recommended. Always carry identification, vehicle
            registration and insurance papers.

            Road tolls can be paid in local currency, Euros, or by credit card. The posted speed
            limits are strictly enforced.
            Money

            The currency is the new Serbian dinar (RSD).

            The economy is largely cash-based. Automated banking machines (ABMs) are widely
            available and provide the easiest access to local currency. More and more hotels,
            restaurants and shops accept credit cards. If you are arriving with cash, you will need
            to exchange it for dinars. All banks and exchange offices will readily convert euros.
            Note that euros are not legal tender in Serbia.

            Traveller\'s cheques (American Express) can be exchanged at only a few banks in
            Belgrade.

            When crossing one of the external border control points of the European Union (EU), you
            must make a declaration to customs upon entry or exit if you have at least â‚¬10,000 or
            the equivalent in other currencies. The sum can be in cash, cheques, money orders,
            traveller\'s cheques or any other convertible assets. This does not apply if you are
            travelling within the EU or in transit to a non-EU country. For more information on the
            EU legislation and links to EU countries\' sites, visit the web page of the European
            Commission on cash controls.
            Customs

            When leaving Serbia, you will need to return a certified copy of Custom declaration so
            the money (up to the amount brought in but not exceeding â‚¬10,000 in value) can be
            taken out again. If you fail to comply with these rules, your money may be confiscated.
            In order to avoid customs charges, you are required to declare items of value (e.g.
            jewellery, photographic and computing equipment) that you are temporarily importing into
            Serbia. These items should be intended for your own personal use and you must take them
            with you when leaving the country.

            cards are not widely accepted and automated banking machines (ABMs) are unavailable. You
            should exchange foreign currency at banks or official foreign exchange offices only. The

            luggage may be inspected for regulated items.

            Common-law relationships are not recognized. Individuals in common-law relationships may
            be requested to provide a certificate of non-impediment to marriage by the local

            driver\'s licence or an IDP in order to honour an insurance claim, even when such proof
            was not requested at the time the policy was secured. An IDP must be obtained in Canada
            before travelling to South Africa, as it cannot be obtained locally.

            If your licence is in French, it is advisable to obtain a translation into English and
            carry it with you.
            Foreigners driving a rental car across any border into neighbouring countries must
            obtain a permit from the Cross-border Road Transport Agency prior to arriving at the
            border crossing. Failure to do so may lead to arrest and/or a fine.
            Money

            The currency is the South African rand (ZAR). Canadian currency and traveller\'s cheques
            can be easily exchanged at major banks and foreign exchange counters. A passport and
            additional identification is required when undertaking foreign exchange transactions.

            Foreigners are permitted to enter South Africa carrying a maximum of ZAR100,000, or
            US$10,000 or its equivalent in foreign currencies. Customs forms are not required to be
            completed, but random customs checks are conducted.

        <item>A permit for photography is required. Permits can be obtained at the Ministry of
            Information. Even with a photography permit, taking pictures of or near military
            installations is strictly prohibited, and it is highly unadvisable to take pictures in
            urban settings.

            Public displays of affection between members of the opposite sex are frowned upon

            Homosexual activity is illegal.
            Culture

            By Western standards, the Republic of South Sudan is a traditional, conservative
            society. Women should dress conservatively (no short skirts, bare arms or low
            necklines); men and women should not wear shorts in public and should be extremely
            discreet when swimming.
            Money

            The currency is the South Sudan pound (SSP). The Sudan pound is not recognized as legal
            tender. Only change money at banks and other established institutions, as money changers
            who operate on the street often scam travellers with counterfeit notes. You should carry
            sufficient funds in U.S. dollars to cover your expenses for the duration of your stay
            and assume that you will have to pay for all international flights booked in South Sudan
            in U.S. dollars. Transferring U.S. or Canadian dollars to the country is impossible.
            Currency exchange houses and merchants do not accept U.S. currency dated before 2006,
            and will reject notes with any marks.

            Credit cards and traveller\'s cheques are not accepted in South Sudan. There are
            automated banking machines (ABMs), but they are not reliable, and only dispense SSPs.
            Larger expenses, such as hotel bills, must be paid in cash.
        </item>
        <item>Canada and Spain are signatories to the European Convention on the Transfer of
            Sentenced Persons. This enables a Canadian imprisoned in Spain to request a transfer to

            Canadian and Spanish authorities.
            Illegal drugs

            Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are strict. Convicted
            offenders can expect jail sentences or heavy fines.
            Illegal activities

            In the cities of Madrid and Barcelona, and in the Balearic and Canary islands, the
            consumption of alcohol in the street, other than in authorized outdoor cafÃ©s and bars,
            has been banned by various municipal or regional authorities. You must respect this law;
            fines are imposed for failure to comply.

            a hands-free device.

            Vehicles must be equipped for emergency situations: two red warning triangles that you
            must place in front of and behind the vehicle in case of accident or breakdown; a
            reflective jacket that you must wear when leaving a vehicle that is stranded or involved
            in a highway accident; and a spare tire and full set of spare light bulbs, plus the
            tools to change them. Drivers who fail to comply with these laws may be subject to
            on-the-spot fines.

            Penalties for drinking and driving are strict. The legal blood alcohol limit is 0.05
            percent or 0.03 percent for new drivers. Convicted offenders can expect heavy fines or
            jail sentences, and driver\'s licences may be confiscated.

            the equivalent in other currencies. The sum can be in cash, cheques, money orders,
            traveller\'s cheques or any other convertible assets. This does not apply if you are
            travelling within the EU or in transit to a non-EU country. For more information on the
            EU legislation and links to EU countries\' sites, visit the web page of the European
            Commission on cash controls.
            Investments

            If you are interested in purchasing property or making other investments in Spain, seek
            legal advice from appropriate professionals in Canada and in Spain before making
            commitments. Disputes arising from such activities could be prolonged and costly to
            resolve.

            or deportation.

            Carry official identification at all times.

            An international driving permit is required.
            Culture

            Money

            The currency is the Sri Lankan rupee (LKR). Most major banks will change U.S. dollar
            traveller\'s cheques as well as permit Visa and MasterCard cash withdrawals. Credit
            cards are widely accepted in major urban and tourist centres. There are automated
            banking machines (ABMs) in major cities, but some do not accept international cards.

        <item>Laws and illegal activities

            Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are severe. Bags are
            routinely searched upon arrival and departure at the Khartoum airport.

            The laws of Sudan prohibit sexual acts between individuals of the same sex. Third time
            convicted offenders can face up to life imprisonment or the death penalty. LGBT
            travellers should carefully consider the risks of travelling to Sudan. See Homosexual,
            bisexual and transgender travel for more information.

            It is prohibited to import or consume alcohol (even in private) and to import magazines

            strictly prohibited to photograph airports, military areas, bridges, drainage stations,
            broadcast stations, public utilities, slum areas or beggars. Any photography without a
            permit immediately draws suspicion of espionage, and individuals, including foreigners,
            have been detained. If you travel with your laptop, ensure that you remove any photo
            files that could be deemed by the authorities as suspicious or controversial.

            It is illegal to use a mobile phone while driving.

            An International Driving Permit is recommended.

            and its export is prohibited. You should carry sufficient funds in U.S. dollars, euros
            or pounds sterling to cover your expenses for the duration of your stay. You may have to
            pay for international flights booked in Sudan in cash: U.S. dollars, euros or pounds
            sterling. Transferring U.S. or Canadian dollars to Sudan is difficult because of
            international sanctions. U.S. currency dated prior to 2006 is not usually accepted.

            Foreign banking and credit cards are not accepted in Sudan. There are automated banking
            machines (ABMs), but they only service local accounts. Traveller\'s cheques are also not

            upon. Due to international sanctions, several foreign credit institutions and banks have
            suspended their transactions with Syria. This includes MasterCard and Visa credit cards
            and bank cards operating under the Cirrus, Maestro and Plus transaction networks; note

            departure. The Syrian pound cannot be exchanged outside the country.

            In August 2011, the Syrian government established limitations on the withdrawal of
            foreign currency in Syria. Regulations regarding financial transactions and currency
            exchange can change without notice.

            stated in the contract before accepting an offer. Written contracts are usually binding
            documents. Verbal agreements may in certain circumstances take precedence over written
            agreements. English teachers should always ensure to obtain proper work permits prior

            Surrogacy

            The Thai Parliament passed a legislation banning commercial surrogacy on February 20,
            2015. While this legislation is awaiting royal approval, Thai authorities may prohibit
            commercial surrogacy and are taking immediate steps to ensure that children of such
            arrangements are not permitted to exit the country in anticipation of the legislation.

            If you are visiting Thailand for the purposes of commercial surrogacy arrangements, you
            should seek independent legal advice before entering into any agreement. In particular,
            legal advice should be sought on the implications of any new exit requirements. A list
            of local lawyers who speak English and/or French is available on the website of the
            Embassy of Canada in Bangkok.

            If you have already entered into such an arrangement, you should also seek advice from a
            local lawyer on how this legislation could affect your situation and, in particular, on
            any exit requirements. You may also wish to contact the consular section of the Embassy
            of Canada in Bangkok to inform them of your particular situation. This will enable them
            to contact you in the event of any developments or should consular assistance be
            required.

        <item>A serious violation may lead to a jail sentence. The sentence will be served in local
            prisons.
            Identification

            Carry adequate identification at all times. Keep a photocopy of your passport in case of
            loss or seizure.

            Local police may ask to see your passport and visa at any time. Always cooperate with
            local authorities. Be aware that you may be detained for up to three hours while your
            identification documents are being verified. Racially motivated mistreatment or
            harassment by Ukrainian authorities occurs.
            Illegal drugs

            Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are strict. Convicted
            offenders can expect jail sentences and heavy fines.
            Driving laws

            An International Driving Permit or a Ukrainian driver\'s licence is required, and car
            insurance is mandatory.

            There is zero tolerance for driving under the influence of alcohol. Police are permitted
            to fine you on the spot.
            Money

            The currency is the hryvnia (UAH).

            The economy operates primarily on a cash basis. However, credit cards are accepted in
            most major cities. Foreign currency can be exchanged at banks, hotels and licensed
            exchange booths. Carry crisp bills, as well-worn or used U.S. banknotes may not be
            accepted. Automated banking machines (ABMs) are available, but new bank cards with a
            microchip cannot be used.
            Customs

            There are strict customs regulations and procedures regarding the export of antiquities
            and items of historical interest.
        </item>
        <item>The work week is from Sunday to Thursday.

            An International Driving Permit is required.
            Laws

            Religious proselytizing is not permitted.

            Common-law relationships, homosexual relations, adultery and prostitution are illegal
            and are subject to severe punishment, including the death penalty.

            Avoid physical contact, such as holding hands, in public.

            Possession of pork is illegal in Sharjah.

            Possession of pornographic material is illegal in all emirates.

            Possession of prohibited items may result in imprisonment and deportation.

            It is forbidden to photograph certain government buildings and military installations.
            Do not photograph people without their permission.

            Procedures to follow in the event of a car accident vary depending on the emirate you
            are visiting. Although you must report all accidents to the police, you should
            familiarize yourself with the rules of the different emirates on whether you may move
            your car to the side of the road in the event of an accident or have to wait until the
            police arrive. Drivers involved in an accident resulting in injuries may be jailed until
            the injured persons are released from hospital. In an accident resulting in fatalities,
            compensation is regularly awarded to the family of the deceased. Lengthy court
            proceedings may result from relatively minor accidents.
            Consumption of prescription or illicit drugs

            Criminal penalties for the possession, use and trafficking of illegal drugs, as well as
            poppy seeds, are strict and include the death penalty. Convicted offenders can expect
            lengthy jail sentences and heavy fines. The possession of drugs, even a very small
            amount, can result in arrest and, if convicted, a four-year minimum prison sentence. The
            use of drugs deemed illegal by U.A.E. authorities, even if used while outside of the
            U.A.E., is a prosecutable offence if traces of the substance are found in the blood or
            urine, and can also carry a minimum prison sentence of four years.

            Canadians have been imprisoned in the U.A.E. for possession, use or trafficking of
            illegal drugs, including drugs used outside of the U.A.E. that were still traceable in
            their blood or urine. Prescription or over-the-counter drugs that are legal in Canada,
            such as codeine, may be restricted in the U.A.E. See Entry/Exit Requirements for more
            information.
            Alcohol consumption

            Respect restrictions concerning the consumption of alcohol. It is illegal for all
            Muslims to consume or possess alcohol. The consumption of alcohol outside approved
            venues is illegal and could result in arrest, fines and imprisonment. Public
            intoxication is a criminal offence, no matter where the alcohol was consumed. There is
            no acceptable legal blood alcohol content limit. You may be required to take blood and
            urine tests if you are suspected of being under the influence of drugs or alcohol. If
            the tests are positive, you may be prosecuted. In Sharjah, the possession and
            consumption of alcohol are illegal and subject to criminal prosecution. There is a zero
            tolerance policy regarding drinking and driving.
            Dress and behaviour

            The country\'s customs, laws and regulations adhere closely to Islamic practices and
            beliefs. Dress conservatively, behave discreetly and respect religious and social
            traditions to avoid offending local sensitivities.

            Women should not wear tight or revealing clothing or short skirts. Men and women should
            both refrain from wearing shorts. Transgressions can lead to detention and other
            penalties.

            Exercise particular care in your behaviour with others, especially officials, to avoid
            offending local sensitivities. Verbal insults and obscene gestures may be considered a
            criminal act and, if found guilty, the accused could face deportation, fines and a
            prison sentence. Canadians have been detained on allegations of showing disrespect
            toward others by making verbal insults and obscene gestures.
            Dual citizenship

            The U.A.E. do not recognize dual citizenship, which may limit the ability of Canadian
            officials to provide consular services. Travel using your Canadian passport and present
            yourself as Canadian to foreign authorities at all times. See Travelling as a dual
            citizen for more information.
            Child custody

            Child custody decisions are based on Islamic (Sharia) law. It is extremely difficult for
            a Canadian woman, even if she is a Muslim, to obtain custody of her children through a
            court decision. Regardless of parental marital status, children of U.A.E. fathers
            acquire U.A.E. citizenship at birth, and must enter and leave the emirates on U.A.E.
            passports. The father\'s permission is required to leave the country.
            Legal process

            Witnesses to incidents, as well as suspects, may be held for lengthy periods without
            access to legal counsel or consular officials. Authorities may withhold the passport of
            an individual involved in legal processes, pending resolution of the case. This could
            result in the delay of a planned departure.

            Familiarize yourself with the rules and laws of each emirate to which you intend to
            travel.

            Courts may impose a sentence of corporal punishment on Muslims convicted of certain
            crimes, even if the individual is not a citizen of the U.A.E. Although the sentence is
            typically commuted to prison time, do not rely on this tendency, as a sentence of
            corporal punishment can still be enforced under Sharia.
            Fraud

            Fraudulent practices, such as writing cheques without sufficient funds, and failing to
            pay your debts are regarded as extremely serious offences and may result in criminal
            prosecution, imprisonment and fines. Penalties are generally assessed according to
            Sharia law. Bail is not available for non-residents of the U.A.E. Temporary release
            pending legal action may be granted in minor cases if the passport of the accused and
            the passport of the guarantor are surrendered to the authorities.
            Employment

            Clearly establish the terms and conditions of employment in writing prior to your
            arrival in the U.A.E. It is customary for a local sponsor to retain an employee\'s
            passport, but this is not required under U.A.E. law. The U.A.E. Ministry of Labour has
            established a special department to review and arbitrate labour claims in cases of
            dispute. A list of local attorneys is available from the Embassy of Canada in Abu Dhabi
            or the Consulate of Canada in Dubai.
            Money

            The currency is the U.A.E. dirham (AED). Major credit cards and traveller\'s cheques are
            accepted in major hotels and restaurants; however, prices may be cheaper if you pay in
            cash. Automated banking machines are widely available.
        </item>
        <item>Canada and United Kingdom are signatories to the European Convention on the Transfer
            of Sentenced Persons. This enables a Canadian imprisoned in United Kingdom to request a
            transfer to a Canadian prison to complete a sentence. The transfer requires the
            agreement of both Canadian and British authorities.
            Driving laws

            Although an International Driving Permit is recommended, you can drive with a valid
            Canadian licence for up to 12 months from your date of entry.

            A fee is charged to those driving into central London. This "congestion charge" is
            indicated by a large "C" painted on the roads. You can pay the fee by phone, online or
            at selected shops and gas stations. Visit the Transport for London website for further
            details.

            Penalties for drinking and driving are strict. Convicted offenders can expect heavy
            fines or jail sentences.
            Imports

            You may import up to one kilogram of meat cooked in a can or hermetically sealed
            container. It is illegal to import firearms, tear gas canisters and certain types of
            knives. The HM Revenue and Customs website provides information on what items you can
            bring into the United Kingdom and what you have to declare.
            Money

            The currency of United Kingdom is the pound sterling (GBP).

            Credit cards are widely accepted and automated banking machines (ABMs) are widely
            available. Traveller\'s cheques are not usually accepted at retail outlets but can be
            exchanged at banks.

            When crossing one of the external border control points of the European Union (EU), you
            must make a declaration to customs upon entry or exit if you have at least â‚¬10,000 or
            the equivalent in other currencies. The sum can be in cash, cheques, money orders,
            traveller\'s cheques or any other convertible assets. This does not apply if you are
            travelling within the EU or in transit to a non-EU country. For more information on the
            EU legislation and links to EU countries\' sites, visit the web page of the European
            Commission on cash controls.
        </item>
        <item>Illegal and prescription drugs

            The U.S. zero tolerance policy imposes severe penalties for the possession of even a
            small amount of an illegal drug.

            Even prescription drugs and syringes used for legitimate medical purposes come under
            intense scrutiny. Carrying medicines in their original containers and carrying a
            duplicate of your original prescription, listing both the generic and trade names of the
            drug, is recommended. Never carry a package or luggage for someone else unless you have
            been able to verify the contents completely.

            Personal medication may be subject to U.S. drug importation laws and regulations. In
            general, personal importation of a 90-day supply of medication is allowed, but only if
            the drug is not available in the U.S. Prescription drugs imported through the mail from
            Canada are carefully scrutinized. For further information, please consult the U.S. Food
            and Drug Administration.
            Laws

            A serious violation of the law may lead to a jail sentence or, in some states, a death
            sentence. The jail sentence will be served in a local prison. Canada and the U.S. do,
            however, have a treaty that permits a Canadian imprisoned in the U.S. to request a
            transfer to Canada to complete the sentence in a Canadian prison. The transfer requires
            the agreement of both Canadian and American authorities. Canadian citizenship confers no
            immunity, special protection or rights to preferential treatment.
            Imports and exports

            A non-resident may bring merchandise worth up to US$200 free of duty for personal or
            household use into the U.S. On visits of 72 hours or more, you may carry an additional
            US$100 worth of merchandise free of duty as gifts for other people. Certain items are
            prohibited. More information is available from the U.S. CBP.

            For information on personal duty purchase exemptions at the border when returning to
            Canada, please consult the Canada Border Services Agency.
            Travel to Cuba

            Residents of the U.S., including Canadian citizens, are subject to U.S. law regarding
            travel to Cuba. They are prohibited from spending money (in any currency) relating to
            Cuban travel unless they are licensed by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC).
            Pets

            When examined at a port of entry, cats and dogs must show no signs of diseases
            communicable to humans. If there is evidence of poor animal health, an examination by a
            licensed veterinarian might be required, at the expense of the owner. The U.S.
            authorities may also require a health certificate. Vaccination against rabies is not
            required for cats. Dogs must be vaccinated against rabies at least 30 days before entry,
            except for puppies under three months of age. Other animals are also subject to controls
            or quarantine requirements. Additional information is available from the U.S. CBP and
            local authorities.

            When you return to Canada, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency will require proof of
            vaccination against rabies for all cats and dogs over three months of age. For detailed
            information, contact the Canadian Food Inspection Agency.
            Automobile insurance

            If you are entering the U.S. by personal automobile, you should check with your
            insurance agent to verify that your existing coverage is valid or sufficient for the
            areas you will be visiting and for the duration of your visit. If you are going to
            remain in a specific location in the U.S. for a considerable period of time, verify with
            the local authorities that your vehicle registration and driver\'s licence will remain
            valid.

            Many states have mandatory automobile insurance requirements, and many require motorists
            to carry appropriate proof of insurance. Each state\'s motor vehicles department can
            give you more specific information. The American Automobile Association and the Canadian
            Automobile Association can provide detailed information to their members.

            If you are in the U.S. and wish to drive to Mexico in your personal vehicle, you may
            need to purchase liability insurance as well as additional auto insurance. Contact your
            insurance agent and the local Mexican tourist office for further information. See our
            Travel Advice and Advisories for Mexico.
            Hitchhiking

            Never cross the border with a hitchhiker or as a hitchhiker. Though you may not be
            carrying anything illegal, the hitchhiker in your vehicle might be, and you could be
            implicated.

            Be equally careful about who and what you carry in your vehicle. As the driver, you
            could be held responsible for the misdeeds of your passengers, even if committed without
            your knowledge or involvement.
            Money

            The currency is the U.S. dollar (USD). Canadian currency, traveller\'s cheques in
            Canadian dollars, and personal cheques drawn on Canadian banks are not widely accepted
            or easily negotiable in the U.S. All major credit cards are accepted throughout the U.S.

            There are banking machines that will accept Canadian bank cards, but these may be
            limited depending on your account access. Despite these difficulties, do not carry large
            amounts of cash. Non-U.S. residents generally cannot negotiate monetary bank instruments
            (international bank drafts, money orders, etc.) without having a U.S. bank account.

            There is no limit to the amount of money that you may legally take into or out of the
            U.S.. However, if you carry more than US$10,000 in monetary instruments (such as U.S. or
            foreign coin, currency, traveller\'s cheques, money orders, stocks or bonds) into or out
            of the U.S., or if you receive more than that amount while in the U.S., you must file a
            report (Customs Form 4790) with U.S. Customs. Failure to comply can result in civil and
            criminal penalties, including seizure of the currency or monetary instruments.

            Illegal or restricted activities

            Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are strict. Convicted
            offenders can expect jail sentences and heavy fines.

            Religious proselytizing is illegal. It is punishable by penalties and/or imprisonment
            for up to 15 days and could lead to deportation.

            Homosexual activity is illegal. Convicted offenders may face jail sentences.

            Photography of public transportation is prohibited and may result in confiscation of
            equipment or detention.
            Dual citizenship

            Dual citizenship is not legally recognized, which may limit the ability of Canadian
            officials to provide consular services. You should travel using your Canadian passport
            and present yourself as Canadian to foreign authorities at all times.

            Canadians with Uzbek citizenship may be subject to national obligations, such as taxes.
            Check your status with the Embassy of the Republic of Uzbekistan in Washington, D.C.,
            prior to departure.

            See Travelling as a dual citizen for more information.
            Religion

            Islamic practices and beliefs are closely adhered to, particularly in rural areas. Dress
            conservatively, behave discreetly, and respect religious and social traditions to avoid
            offending local sensitivities.
            Money

            The currency is the Uzbek sum (UZS), which is used for most transactions. However, U.S.
            dollars can also be used. Carry bills in pristine condition, as well-worn or used U.S.
            banknotes may not be accepted. Only a few major hotels and restaurants accept credit
            cards. Traveller\'s cheques can only be cashed at the National Bank of Uzbekistan.
            Purchasing money on the black market is illegal and may result in extortion or jail
            sentences. There are no automated banking machines.

            screened for drugs by the Bolivarian National Guard.
            Laws

            Venezuela has strict regulations concerning the importation of foreign-registered motor
            vehicles. Offenders face heavy fines and/or confiscation of the vehicle. Before arrival,
            contact the Embassy of Venezuela for the most up-to-date regulations and procedures.

            Photography of sensitive installations, including the presidential palace, military
            sites, government buildings and airports, is prohibited.

            An International Driving Permit is recommended.
            Currency

            In 2008, the denomination of the Venezuelan currency changed from the bolÃ­var to the
            bolÃ­var fuerte (VEF), abbreviated locally as Bs.F. You should be aware of the value
            change: 1,000 bolÃ­vares correspond to 1 Bs.F.

            The law prohibits the sale and purchase of any foreign currency outside of authorized
            institutions, such as currency exchange houses or banks. Be wary of individuals trying
            to buy your dollars at the airport. Anyone caught exchanging foreign currency is subject
            to a fine. Banks often restrict transactions to their clients only. Exchange houses may
            be scarce outside of major cities.

            Only U.S. dollars can be exchanged, and only at official exchange houses. They cannot be
            used for transactions. If you are entering or leaving Venezuela with more than
            US$10,000, you are required to declare it to the authorities. Anyone convicted of
            selling or purchasing foreign currency above US$20,000 is subject to detention and a
            fine.

            The bolÃ­var fuerte cannot be exchanged outside Venezuela. For more information on
            currency exchange and international transactions, consult the ComisiÃ³n de
            AdministraciÃ³n de Divisas (in Spanish).

            Credit cards are generally accepted at major hotels, at resorts and at airports. Many
            stores do not accept international cards. Identification is required for any credit card
            transaction. Credit card fraud can occur.

            Visitors are not allowed to invite Vietnamese nationals of the opposite sex into their
            hotel rooms to stay overnight. Visitors are allowed to stay with a Vietnamese family,

            including jewellery, gold bar and raw gold, must also make a declaration.

            Vietnamese law restricts the export of antiques, but these laws are vague and unevenly
            enforced. If you purchase non-antique items of value, retain receipts and confirmation
            from shop owners and/or the Ministry of Culture and the Vietnam General Department of
            Customs to prevent seizure of your items upon departure.

            hotels throughout the country, as well as at an increasing number of restaurants and
            shops. Automated banking machines are available throughout Vietnam.

            Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are strict.

            Public intoxication is a criminal offence, no matter where the alcohol was consumed.
            Consumption of alcohol outside approved venues is illegal and could result in arrest
            and/or fines and imprisonment. There is a zero tolerance policy regarding drinking and
            driving.

            It is forbidden to photograph military and police personnel and installations, and
            government buildings. Military sites are not always clearly marked. Do not photograph

            Importation of alcohol is restricted, and prohibited to Muslims.

            Importing pork products and pornographic material and exporting antiquities are
            forbidden.
            Dual citizenship

            Dual citizenship is not legally recognized, which may limit the ability of Canadian
            officials to provide consular services. You should travel using your Canadian passport
            and present yourself as Canadian to foreign authorities at all times. Dual citizens may
            be subject to national obligations, such as military service and taxes. See Travelling
            as a dual citizen for more information.
            Family

            Canadian children or spouses may be prevented from leaving the country without prior
            authorization of the father/husband.

            Child custody decisions are based on Islamic law. It is extremely difficult for a
            Canadian woman, even if she is a Muslim, to obtain custody of her children through
            Yemeni courts.
            Dress and behaviour

            The country\'s customs, laws and regulations adhere closely to Islamic practices and
            beliefs. Dress conservatively, behave discreetly and respect religious and social
            traditions to avoid offending local sensitivities.
            Money

            The currency is the Yemeni rial (YER). The economy is primarily cash-based. Credit cards
            and traveller\'s cheques are accepted in some major hotels. Canadian currency and
            traveller\'s cheques are not accepted. Automated banking machines may only be available
            in major cities.

        <item>Laws

            The possession or use of narcotics, including "soft" drugs such as marijuana, is
            strictly prohibited. Convicted offenders could face stiff penalties, including long jail
            sentences and/or deportation.

            Do not carry non-prescription medication containing diphenhydramine, such as Benadryl,
            as this ingredient is on the Zambian list of controlled substances. Some travellers have
            been charged with drug trafficking and have been incarcerated.

            Prescription medicine should always be carried in the original container along with a
            copy of the prescription; ensure that both the generic and trade names of the drug are
            included. A doctor\'s note describing why you are taking the medication is also
            recommended. Failure to do so could result in arrest and imprisonment.

            Homosexual activity is illegal.

            The possession of pornographic material is illegal in Zambia, and offenders may be
            jailed and/or deported.

            Avoid military zones. Photography of military installations is prohibited. Ask
            permission before photographing individuals.

            Traffic drives on the left. Turning left at a red light is prohibited. Penalties for
            drunk driving are severe.

            not accepted anywhere in Zambia. You should carry cash in U.S. dollars, U.K. pounds, or
            South African rand. Major credit cards are accepted in larger supermarkets, restaurants,
            stores and hotels in large urban centres only.

            Illegal and restricted activities

            Demonstrations and assemblies, even for private meetings, are illegal in Zimbabwe if not
            pre-approved by the Government. Bystanders have been known to be taken into custody at
            such events. Police officers may request to attend meetings. Avoid large crowds or
            gatherings, particularly political meetings or rallies.

            Photography of government offices, airports, military establishments, official
            residences and embassies, in addition to other sensitive facilities, is prohibited
            unless permission is granted from the Zimbabwe Ministry of Information. Special permits
            may be needed for other photography. Laws are strictly enforced, and all restrictions
            should be observed. If in doubt, do not take a picture.

            It is a criminal offence in Zimbabwe to make derogatory or insulting comments about
            President Mugabe, a member of his government, or the Zimbabwean government itself. Any
            person making such comments is liable to arrest and prosecution. Avoid participating in
            political discussions in public places or engaging in political activity. Note that an
            open hand is the symbol of the main opposition political party, and that therefore a
            friendly wave could be misinterpreted as a provocative gesture. Avoid carrying books by
            banned authors, and in rural areas, do not carry copies of the main independent
            newspapers, such as the Financial Gazette, the Independent and the Standard.

            The use of a cellular telephone without using a hands-free device while driving is
            illegal and may result in a fine.

            Homosexual activity is illegal.

            Possession or importation of pornographic material is forbidden.
            Currency

            The payment of goods and services in Zimbabwe is now allowed in certain foreign
            currencies, including the U.S. dollar, South African rand and Botswana pula. The
            Zimbabwe dollar is no longer in use and is not accepted by stores.

            Remain cautious, as counterfeit notes can be found in circulation. For safety reasons,
            do not attempt to change currency at unregistered currency exchange offices or outlets.

            Most hotel charges for foreigners are based on a U.S. dollar rate and must be paid in
            cash from internationally convertible currency (typically U.S. dollars or British
            pounds). Credit cards are not widely accepted but some large vendors, such as
            supermarkets, may accept payment by credit card. Please note, not all Canadian credit
            cards are compatible with the local banking technology. Consult your travel agent or
            hotel in advance of your trip for details of your specific cards. Banks accept
            traveller\'s cheques for conversion to cash in foreign currency. Passport photocopies
            are not accepted by banks for monetary transactions. You will need to show your original
            piece of identification.

            It is not possible to use ABMs to withdraw U.S. dollars with a Canadian debit card.
            Foreign debit cards are not accepted at points of sale. Local cards which are part of
            the Zimswitch network may be accepted.

            You can send and receive money via Western Union in Zimbabwe. In addition, you can send
            and receive money using the local cellphone provider, Econet, by depositing money in an
            account at a local post office. Travellers leaving the country can take out up to
            US$5,000 cash or the equivalent in other foreign currencies. If you wish to take out
            additional foreign currency, you are required to seek permission from the Reserve Bank
            of Zimbabwe. Presently, there are no traveller\'s cheques in the country.
