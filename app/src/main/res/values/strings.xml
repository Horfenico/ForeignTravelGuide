            Iran - AVOID ALL TRAVEL

            Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development Canada advises against all travel to to Iran. On September 7, 2012, Canada closed its embassy in Iran.

            Because of heightened regional tensions, Canadian travellers in Iran will be closely watched by Iranian authorities. Iranian irritation at the Embassy closure may heighten this scrutiny of Canadians. Seemingly innocuous behaviours, such as the use of cameras in public places, travel beyond well-established tourist attractions, or casual interactions with Iranian friends, may be misinterpreted and may lead to investigation and harassment. Canadian travellers may be arbitrarily questioned, arrested and detained for a long period.

            Canadians who choose to travel to Iran despite this warning should know that the Government of Canada’s ability to offer consular services in Iran is very limited and should expect delays if they request travel documents or a replacement for a lost or stolen passport. Ensure that your travel documents are up to date. Canadians in Iran seeking routine consular and passport services should contact the Embassy of Canada in Ankara, Turkey or any other Canadian mission. Canadians in Iran who require urgent assistance may contact the Emergency Watch and Response Centre in Ottawa at 613-996-8885 (collect calls accepted), by email sos@international.gc.ca or by submitting an on-line form.

            Dual citizenship

            In the context of heightened regional tensions, Iranian-Canadian dual citizens may be particularly vulnerable to investigation and harassment by Iranian authorities. Canadians who have Iranian nationality are warned in particular that the Iranian regime does not recognize the principle of dual citizenship. By doing so, the Iranian regime makes it virtually impossible for Government of Canada officials to provide consular assistance to Iranian-Canadians in difficulty.

            Syria - AVOID ALL TRAVEL

            Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development Canada advises against all travel to Syria due to ongoing conflict. Commercial means to leave Syria are extremely limited, and you should leave as soon as it is safe to do so. Since November 2011, DFATD has urged Canadians to leave Syria. Many airlines, including Arab League carriers, have suspended their flights from Syria. Battles between Syrian and opposition armed forces have taken place in the vicinity of the airports in Damascus and Aleppo, which could be closed quickly, with little or no notice, and checkpoints may delay or impede access to the airport. Contact your airline to check the status of your flight before travelling to the airport. We strongly recommend that Canadians register with the Registration of Canadians Abroad service.

            If you are leaving Syria by land to Lebanon, transit through the border area as quickly as possible, as we advise against all travel to the border region with Lebanon.

            If you choose to remain in Syria despite this warning, limit your movements and keep abreast of the latest developments. Outbreaks of violence can occur with little or no notice, and you risk being at the wrong place at the wrong time. Ensure your travel documents are up to date.

            Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are strict. Convicted offenders can expect jail sentences and heavy fines.
            Illegal activities

            Do not photograph military installations or personnel without proper permission as it is illegal; charges may be laid or cameras may be confiscated.
            Marriages

            If a Canadian intends to marry an Albanian, the Albanian partner should provide the list of documentation required to get married in Albania and documents must be legalized by the Embassy of Albania in Ottawa. For further details, please contact the Consulate of Canada in Albania.
            Homosexual activities

            While homosexuality is not illegal in Albania, it is not widely accepted. Exercise discretion as Albanian society is very conservative.
            Driving laws

            An International Driving Permit (IDP) is required as a supplement to a valid driver’s licence.

            Laws against drinking and driving are strictly enforced.

            The use of cellular phones while driving is prohibited.

            Police have taken drastic measures to decrease the number of accidents. Respect speed limits and the rules of the road in order to avoid heavy fines and the suspension of your driving licence.
            Money

            The currency of Albania is the lek (ALL). The euro is used as a benchmark for the currency.

            Under Algerian law, men under the age of 35 must complete their military service. There have been cases of Canadian citizens who also have Algerian citizenship being refused permission to leave the country because they did not possess a card exempting them from military service, a deferment card, or evidence that they have completed their military service. While the Embassy of Canada will attempt to help individuals in this situation, they are considered to be Algerian citizens by Algerian authorities.
            Dress and behaviour

            Islamic practices and beliefs are closely adhered to in the country’s customs, laws and regulations. Dress conservatively, behave discreetly, and respect religious and social traditions to avoid offending local sensitivities. It would be prudent for women to cover their arms and legs and wear a headscarf.
            Money

            The currency is the Algerian dinar (DZD), which is non-convertible. Convert any excess currency prior to departure from Algeria. Cash is the preferred method of payment in Algeria. Traveller's cheques and credit cards are not accepted outside of major hotels and some business establishments such as airline companies. Automated banking machines (ABMs) are available in a few major hotels and banks, although they are often unreliable.

            Canada and Andorra are signatories to the European Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons. This enables a Canadian imprisoned in Andorra to request a transfer to a Canadian prison to complete a sentence. The transfer requires the agreement of both Canadian and Andorran authorities.
            Illegal drugs

            Andorran authorities practise zero tolerance with respect to possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs. Penalties are strict.
            Driving laws

            An International Driving Permit is recommended.

            Children under 10 years of age are not allowed to sit in the front passenger seat.

            The use of cellular telephones while driving is prohibited, unless they are fitted with a hands-free device.

            Vehicles must be equipped for emergency situations: two red warning triangles that you must place in front of and behind the vehicle in case of accident or breakdown; a reflective jacket that you must wear when leaving a vehicle that is stranded or involved in a highway accident; and a spare tire and full set of spare light bulbs, plus the tools to change them. Drivers who fail to comply with these laws may be subject to on-the-spot fines.

            Penalties for drinking and driving are strict. The legal blood alcohol limit is 0.05 percent. Convicted offenders can expect heavy fines or jail, and driver's licences may be confiscated immediately.
            Customs

            Andorra is not a member of the European Union, and purchases of duty-free tobacco, liquor and luxury goods are subject to taxes and duties on re-entering European Union countries. France and Spain apply strict rules on the amount of tobacco imported from Andorra for personal use. Canadians should contact the Embassy of the Principality of Andorra in New York for specific information regarding customs requirements.
            Money

            The currency of Andorra is the euro (EUR).

            When crossing one of the external border control points of the European Union (EU), you must make a declaration to customs upon entry or exit if you have at least €10,000, or the equivalent in other currencies. The sum can be in cash, cheques, money orders, traveller’s cheques or any other convertible assets. This does not apply if you are travelling within the EU or in transit to a non-EU country.

            Laws and illegal activities

            Involvement in black-market currency conversion could lead to arrest.

            Punishment for drug-related offences can be severe.

            The laws of Angola prohibit sexual acts between individuals of the same sex. LGBT travellers should carefully consider the risks of travelling to Angola. See Homosexual, bisexual and transgender travel for more information.

            Some handicrafts considered of cultural value may be retained by customs. It is illegal to remove turtle shells and ivory from the country.

            Avoid photographing airports, major roads, bridges, communications installations, military personnel and government buildings. Taking photos of urban areas may be frowned upon by police.

            An International Driving Permit is recommended.
            Dual citizenship

            Although dual nationality is legally recognized in Angola, Angolan nationality takes precedence according to local law. Holding dual nationality may limit the ability of Canadian officials to provide consular services. See Travelling as a dual citizen for more information.
            Money

            The currency in Angola is the kwanza (AOA). It is not convertible on the international market. Dollars can be converted into kwanzas, or vice versa, at the few exchange bureaus in Luanda or at local banks. Receiving foreign currency is often very difficult due to present scarcity (even for those with foreign currency accounts). Kwanzas cannot be taken out of the country. No more than US$15,000 can be taken into or out of Angola, unless an official declaration is made upon entry.

            Newer U.S.-dollar bills are favoured, due to the ease with which the older bills are counterfeited. Credit cards are accepted at only a few of Luanda’s largest hotels and restaurants, and it varies as to which cards are accepted. VISA is the most commonly accepted credit card. Leave a copy of your card information with a trusted family member or friend in case of emergency.

            Traveller’s cheques are difficult to cash in Angola; normally, they are accepted only at some of the best hotels.

            Automated banking machines dispense kwanzas only. Some ABMs in Luanda accept VISA cards, but only to withdraw kwanzas. Note that machines often malfunction or run out of cash. Debit cards do not work.

            Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are strict.
            Driving laws

            An International Driving Permit is not recognized. You must bring your Canadian driver’s licence in order to purchase an Anguillan driver's licence.
            Marriages

            If planning to marry in Anguilla, ensure that you meet all requirements and have all necessary documents before leaving Canada. Most countries require a certificate stating that there are no Canadian impediments to your marriage.
            Money

            The currency of Anguilla is the East Caribbean dollar (XCD).
            Investments

            If you are interested in purchasing property or making other investments in Anguilla, seek legal advice from professionals in Canada and in Anguilla before making commitments. Disputes arising from such activities could be prolonged and costly to resolve.

            The Protocol to the Antarctic Treaty on Environmental Protection (Madrid Protocol), adopted in 1991 by the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties, designates Antarctica as a natural reserve, devoted to peace and science. Several areas have ecological, scientific, historical or other value and are afforded special protection. It is forbidden to bring any non-native species into Antarctica. This includes poultry, pet dogs, pet cats and household plants. It is also prohibited to take or harmfully interfere with Antarctic wildlife except in accordance with a permit issued by a national authority.

            The Madrid Protocol came into force in 1998 and was ratified by 30 countries. Under the Madrid Protocol, parties are required to regulate the activities of expeditions organized in or proceeding from their territory to the Antarctic, as well as the activities of their vessels, aircraft and Antarctic stations.

            Canada ratified the Madrid Protocol in December 2003, and developed the Antarctic Environmental Protection Act and its supporting regulation to implement the Protocol in Canada. In so doing, the Canadian government oversees the activities of its citizens in the Antarctic, and provides the means to address potential future environmental risks in the Antarctic.
