            AFGHANISTAN - AVOID ALL TRAVEL

            Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development Canada advises against all travel to Afghanistan,

            warning, you are taking a serious risk. We strongly recommend that Canadians register
            with the Registration of Canadians Abroad (ROCA) service and include personal and
            professional contact details. If you are already in Afghanistan, you should leave. The
            Embassy of Canada in Afghanistan\'s ability to provide consular and other support
            throughout the country is very limited.

            coverage with your health insurance provider. Access to medical services may be scarce.
            Should you require medical evacuation, service availability is limited and can cost
            hundreds of thousands of dollars, and you would assume sole responsibility for any
            costs. The Government of Canada cannot guarantee access to medical evacuation services.

            economic tensions in the country. Clashes between young demonstrators and law
            enforcement authorities have been frequent, especially in Conakry, where incidents of

            Iran - AVOID ALL TRAVEL

            Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development Canada advises against all travel to to Iran. On
            September 7, 2012, Canada closed its embassy in Iran.

            Because of heightened regional tensions, Canadian travellers in Iran will be closely
            watched by Iranian authorities. Iranian irritation at the Embassy closure may heighten
            this scrutiny of Canadians. Seemingly innocuous behaviours, such as the use of cameras
            in public places, travel beyond well-established tourist attractions, or casual
            interactions with Iranian friends, may be misinterpreted and may lead to investigation
            and harassment. Canadian travellers may be arbitrarily questioned, arrested and detained
            for a long period.

            Canadians who choose to travel to Iran despite this warning should know that the
            Government of Canada’s ability to offer consular services in Iran is very limited and
            should expect delays if they request travel documents or a replacement for a lost or
            stolen passport. Ensure that your travel documents are up to date. Canadians in Iran
            seeking routine consular and passport services should contact the Embassy of Canada in
            Ankara, Turkey or any other Canadian mission. Canadians in Iran who require urgent
            assistance may contact the Emergency Watch and Response Centre in Ottawa at 613-996-8885
            (collect calls accepted), by email sos@international.gc.ca or by submitting an on-line
            form.

            Dual citizenship

            In the context of heightened regional tensions, Iranian-Canadian dual citizens may be
            particularly vulnerable to investigation and harassment by Iranian authorities.
            Canadians who have Iranian nationality are warned in particular that the Iranian regime
            does not recognize the principle of dual citizenship. By doing so, the Iranian regime
            makes it virtually impossible for Government of Canada officials to provide consular
            assistance to Iranian-Canadians in difficulty.

            situation throughout Iraq is very volatile, dangerous and unpredictable, and could

            If you choose to travel to Iraq despite this warning, ensure that you are accompanied by
            professional security escorts at all times and carefully review your security

            assistance in all parts of Iraq is severely limited. See Security for more information.

            Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development Canada advises against non-essential travel to
            Liberia due to the Ebola outbreak, resulting in lowered access to quality health care.

            There is no Government of Canada office in Liberia. Therefore, our ability to provide
            consular assistance is extremely limited. If you decide to remain in or travel to
            Liberia despite this Advisory, verify your coverage with your health insurance provider.
            Access to medical services may be scarce. Should you require medical evacuation, service
            availability is limited and can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars, and you would

            Libya - AVOID ALL TRAVEL

            Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development Canada advises against all travel to Libya due to
            persistent insecurity throughout the country, including sustained armed conflict, a high
            risk of terrorist attacks, an unpredictable political situation and a high crime rate.
            If you are presently in Libya, you should leave now by the safest means possible.

            The Government of Canada’s ability to provide consular services to Canadian citizens in
            Libya is extremely limited. The Embassy of Canada to Libya in Tripoli has suspended
            operations until further notice. Canadian officials have left the country. Canadians in
            Libya should contact the Embassy of Canada to Tunisia in Tunis or the Emergency Watch
            and Response Centre in Ottawa for emergency consular assistance. We strongly recommend
            that Canadians register with the Registration of Canadians Abroad (ROCA) service.

            Canadian citizens travelling to or remaining in Libya despite this advice should ensure
            that their travel documents are up to date, limit their movements and keep abreast of

            Syria - AVOID ALL TRAVEL

            Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development Canada advises against all travel to Syria due to
            ongoing conflict. Commercial means to leave Syria are extremely limited, and you should
            leave as soon as it is safe to do so. Since November 2011, DFATD has urged Canadians to
            leave Syria. Many airlines, including Arab League carriers, have suspended their flights
            from Syria. Battles between Syrian and opposition armed forces have taken place in the
            vicinity of the airports in Damascus and Aleppo, which could be closed quickly, with
            little or no notice, and checkpoints may delay or impede access to the airport. Contact
            your airline to check the status of your flight before travelling to the airport. We
            strongly recommend that Canadians register with the Registration of Canadians Abroad
            service.

            If you are leaving Syria by land to Lebanon, transit through the border area as quickly
            as possible, as we advise against all travel to the border region with Lebanon.

            If you choose to remain in Syria despite this warning, limit your movements and keep
            abreast of the latest developments. Outbreaks of violence can occur with little or no
            notice, and you risk being at the wrong place at the wrong time. Ensure your travel
            documents are up to date.

            Donetsk or Luhansk Oblasts and are unable to exit the region safely, remain indoors,
            maintain a low profile and avoid large crowds and demonstrations.

            See Security for more information.

            Regional Advisory for the Kharkiv Oblast

            Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development Canada (DFATD) advises against non-essential

            Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development Canada advises against non-essential travel to
            areas bordering the DRC, Angola and Mozambique. The possibility of border conflicts
            and/or the presence of refugees and armed combatants make these areas potentially
            dangerous and unstable. Carjacking and armed assaults also pose a risk. Landmines

            The currency is the afghani (AFN). The economy operates on a cash-only basis. Credit
            cards are not widely accepted. U.S. dollars are accepted but should be recent and in

            of both Canadian and Albanian authorities.
            Identification

            You must carry adequate identification at all times, such as a legible photocopy of your
            passport. To avoid the loss or theft of your identification documents, you should not
            carry your original passport, citizenship card or birth certificate with you, except
            when travelling from one city to another within Albania.
            Illegal drugs

            Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are strict. Convicted
            offenders can expect jail sentences and heavy fines.
            Illegal activities

            Do not photograph military installations or personnel without proper permission as it is
            illegal; charges may be laid or cameras may be confiscated.
            Marriages

            If a Canadian intends to marry an Albanian, the Albanian partner should provide the list
            of documentation required to get married in Albania and documents must be legalized by
            the Embassy of Albania in Ottawa. For further details, please contact the Consulate of
            Canada in Albania.
            Homosexual activities

            While homosexuality is not illegal in Albania, it is not widely accepted. Exercise
            discretion as Albanian society is very conservative.
            Driving laws

            An International Driving Permit (IDP) is required as a supplement to a valid driver\'s
            licence.

            Laws against drinking and driving are strictly enforced.

            The use of cellular phones while driving is prohibited.

            Police have taken drastic measures to decrease the number of accidents. Respect speed
            limits and the rules of the road in order to avoid heavy fines and the suspension of
            your driving licence.
            Money

            The currency of Albania is the lek (ALL). The euro is used as a benchmark for the
            currency.

            The economy is primarily cash-based. You should carry some cash, as traveller\'s cheques
            and credit cards are not widely accepted. International hotels in Tirana accept American
            Express, Visa, Diners Club and MasterCard. Automated banking machines are widely
            available.

            Traveller\'s cheques and eurocheques can be exchanged at the National Bank of Albania in
            Tirana. U.S. dollars and Swiss francs are also accepted.

            Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are strict. Convicted
            offenders can expect detention or other penalties.
            Dual citizenship

            Dual citizenship is not legally recognized, which may limit the ability of Canadian
            officials to provide consular services. You should travel using your Canadian passport
            and present yourself as Canadian to foreign authorities at all times. See Travelling as
            a dual citizen for more information.

            Under Algerian law, men under the age of 35 must complete their military service. There
            have been cases of Canadian citizens who also have Algerian citizenship being refused
            permission to leave the country because they did not possess a card exempting them from
            military service, a deferment card, or evidence that they have completed their military
            service. While the Embassy of Canada will attempt to help individuals in this situation,
            they are considered to be Algerian citizens by Algerian authorities.
            Dress and behaviour

            Islamic practices and beliefs are closely adhered to in the country\'s customs, laws and
            regulations. Dress conservatively, behave discreetly, and respect religious and social
            traditions to avoid offending local sensitivities. It would be prudent for women to
            cover their arms and legs and wear a headscarf.
            Money

            The currency is the Algerian dinar (DZD), which is non-convertible. Convert any excess
            currency prior to departure from Algeria. Cash is the preferred method of payment in
            Algeria. Traveller\'s cheques and credit cards are not accepted outside of major hotels
            and some business establishments such as airline companies. Automated banking machines
            (ABMs) are available in a few major hotels and banks, although they are often
            unreliable.

            Canadian and Andorran authorities.
            Illegal drugs

            Andorran authorities practise zero tolerance with respect to possession, use or
            trafficking of illegal drugs. Penalties are strict.
            Driving laws

            An International Driving Permit is recommended.

            Children under 10 years of age are not allowed to sit in the front passenger seat.

            The use of cellular telephones while driving is prohibited, unless they are fitted with
            a hands-free device.

            Vehicles must be equipped for emergency situations: two red warning triangles that you
            must place in front of and behind the vehicle in case of accident or breakdown; a
            reflective jacket that you must wear when leaving a vehicle that is stranded or involved
            in a highway accident; and a spare tire and full set of spare light bulbs, plus the
            tools to change them. Drivers who fail to comply with these laws may be subject to
            on-the-spot fines.

            Penalties for drinking and driving are strict. The legal blood alcohol limit is 0.05
            percent. Convicted offenders can expect heavy fines or jail, and driver\'s licences may
            be confiscated immediately.
            Customs

            Andorra is not a member of the European Union, and purchases of duty-free tobacco,
            liquor and luxury goods are subject to taxes and duties on re-entering European Union
            countries. France and Spain apply strict rules on the amount of tobacco imported from
            Andorra for personal use. Canadians should contact the Embassy of the Principality of
            Andorra in New York for specific information regarding customs requirements.
            Money

            The currency of Andorra is the euro (EUR).

            When crossing one of the external border control points of the European Union (EU), you
            must make a declaration to customs upon entry or exit if you have at least â‚¬10,000, or
            the equivalent in other currencies. The sum can be in cash, cheques, money orders,
            traveller\'s cheques or any other convertible assets. This does not apply if you are
            travelling within the EU or in transit to a non-EU country. For more information on the
            EU legislation and links to EU countries\' sites, visit the web page of the European
            Commission on cash controls.

        <item>Laws and illegal activities

            Involvement in black-market currency conversion could lead to arrest.

            Punishment for drug-related offences can be severe.

            The laws of Angola prohibit sexual acts between individuals of the same sex. LGBT
            travellers should carefully consider the risks of travelling to Angola. See Homosexual,
            bisexual and transgender travel for more information.

            Some handicrafts considered of cultural value may be retained by customs. It is illegal
            to remove turtle shells and ivory from the country.

            Avoid photographing airports, major roads, bridges, communications installations,
            military personnel and government buildings. Taking photos of urban areas may be frowned
            upon by police.

            An International Driving Permit is recommended.
            Dual citizenship

            Although dual nationality is legally recognized in Angola, Angolan nationality takes
            precedence according to local law. Holding dual nationality may limit the ability of
            Canadian officials to provide consular services. See Travelling as a dual citizen for
            more information.
            Money

            The currency in Angola is the kwanza (AOA). It is not convertible on the international
            market. Dollars can be converted into kwanzas, or vice versa, at the few exchange
            bureaus in Luanda or at local banks. Receiving foreign currency is often very difficult
            due to present scarcity (even for those with foreign currency accounts). Kwanzas cannot
            be taken out of the country. No more than US$15,000 can be taken into or out of Angola,
            unless an official declaration is made upon entry.

            Newer U.S.-dollar bills are favoured, due to the ease with which the older bills are
            counterfeited. Credit cards are accepted at only a few of Luanda\'s largest hotels and
            restaurants, and it varies as to which cards are accepted. VISA is the most commonly
            accepted credit card. Leave a copy of your card information with a trusted family member
            or friend in case of emergency.

            Traveller\'s cheques are difficult to cash in Angola; normally, they are accepted only
            at some of the best hotels.

            Automated banking machines dispense kwanzas only. Some ABMs in Luanda accept VISA cards,
            but only to withdraw kwanzas. Note that machines often malfunction or run out of cash.
            Debit cards do not work.

            Marriages

            If planning to marry in Anguilla, ensure that you meet all requirements and have all
            necessary documents before leaving Canada. Most countries require a certificate stating
            that there are no Canadian impediments to your marriage.

        <item>The Protocol to the Antarctic Treaty on Environmental Protection (Madrid Protocol),
            adopted in 1991 by the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties, designates Antarctica as a
            natural reserve, devoted to peace and science. Several areas have ecological,
            scientific, historical or other value and are afforded special protection. It is
            forbidden to bring any non-native species into Antarctica. This includes poultry, pet
            dogs, pet cats and household plants. It is also prohibited to take or harmfully
            interfere with Antarctic wildlife except in accordance with a permit issued by a
            national authority.

            The Madrid Protocol came into force in 1998 and was ratified by 30 countries. Under the
            Madrid Protocol, parties are required to regulate the activities of expeditions
            organized in or proceeding from their territory to the Antarctic, as well as the
            activities of their vessels, aircraft and Antarctic stations.

            Canada ratified the Madrid Protocol in December 2003, and developed the Antarctic
            Environmental Protection Act and its supporting regulation to implement the Protocol in
            Canada. In so doing, the Canadian government oversees the activities of its citizens in
            the Antarctic, and provides the means to address potential future environmental risks in
            the Antarctic.

            If planning to marry in Antigua and Barbuda, ensure that you meet all requirements
            before leaving Canada. Most countries require you to produce a certificate stating that
            there are no Canadian impediments to your marriage. You should arrange to obtain the
            certificate in Canada before your departure.
            Driving laws

            You must have a local driving permit to drive in Antigua and Barbuda. It can be obtained
            for EC$50 (approximately C$20) at any car rental agency or police station upon
            presentation of a valid Canadian driver\'s licence.

            The currency is the Argentine peso (ARS). The Government of Argentina has imposed
            restrictions on the purchase of foreign currency in Argentina. As a result, many
            businesses catering to tourists now accept U.S. dollars as a way to access foreign
            currency. Currency exchange restrictions are subject to daily changes. Monitor local
            news for update on these restrictions.

            Foreign credit and debit cards are accepted in main cities. When using credit cards,
            ensure that your card remains in view. You may be required to produce photo
            identification, such as a driver\'s licence or a photocopy of your passport, when paying
            with a credit card. Cash withdrawals from foreign bank accounts at ABMs are subject to

            Possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs may result in jail sentences and heavy
            fines.

            There is zero tolerance for drinking and driving.

            You may be fined for photographing military installations or government buildings. Seek
            permission from local authorities before taking photographs.

            The export of cultural items is regulated.
            Dual citizenship

            Dual citizenship is legally recognized in Armenia, but Armenian citizenship takes
            precedence. Canadian officials may, therefore, be limited in their ability to provide
            consular services to Canadian-Armenian citizens.

            Canadian-Armenian citizens may also be subject to national obligations, such as taxes
            and military service. Check your status with the Embassy of the Republic of Armenia in
            Canada. Dual nationals who try to avoid the compulsory military service may be detained
            for draft evasion and face hefty fines or imprisonment.

            See Travelling as a dual citizen for more information.
            Money

            The currency is the Armenian dram (AMD). The economy is primarily cash-based. U.S.
            dollars and credit cards are generally accepted when paying for hotel accommodation.
            There are no limitations on exchange of foreign currency. However, amounts exceeding
            US$10,000 must be declared at border crossings. Some banks may not accept a foreign bank
            card at automated banking machines, but you can make withdrawals at the counter with
            your passport as identification.

            Homosexuality is illegal, and is punishable by imprisonment and deportation.

            Common-law relationships are tolerated but not recognized.

            Avoid physical contact, for example, holding hands, in public.

            Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are strict and include the
            death penalty. Convicted offenders can expect lengthy jail sentences and/or heavy fines.
            The possession of drugs, even a very small amount, can result in arrest and, if
            convicted, a four-year minimum prison term.

            Alcohol is available for purchase by non-Muslims at special stores. Observe restrictions
            concerning the consumption of alcohol. Attitudes regarding alcohol are not favourable.

            There is a zero-tolerance policy regarding drinking and driving. Drinking while in

            pornography or seditious literature; and habit-forming or hallucinatory drugs.
            Legal process

            If you are involved in Bahraini court proceedings due to indebtedness, labour
            disagreement or other legal dispute, you may be prevented from leaving Bahrain until
            your case is resolved.
            Dress and behaviour

            The country\'s customs, laws and regulations adhere closely to Islamic practices and
            beliefs. Dress conservatively, behave discreetly and respect religious and social
            traditions to avoid offending local sensitivities. For example, women should cover their
            arms and legs, and men should not wear shorts in public.

            You may be subject to heavy fines if showing disrespect toward officials by making
            verbal insults and obscene gestures.
            Child custody

            Child custody decisions are based on Islamic law. It is extremely difficult for a
            Canadian woman, even if she is Muslim, to obtain custody of her children through a
            Bahraini court decision. Regardless of their parents\' marital status, minor children of
            a Bahraini father may not leave Bahrain without their father\'s permission.
            Dual citizenship

            Dual citizenship is not legally recognized, which may limit the ability of Canadian

            than 5,000 taka and export more than 500 taka.

            Property disputes, including those between family members, are common and can turn
            violent. You should contact a local lawyer if you find yourself in such a situation.

            Muslims are prohibited from consuming alcohol. Transgressions could be punished by
            detention or other penalties.

            Culture

            Bangladesh prides itself on being a secular nation with a predominantly Muslim
            population. Local laws reflect the fact that Bangladesh has strongly conservative social
            norms.

            Dress conservatively, behave discreetly, and respect religious and social traditions to
            avoid offending local sensitivities. Women in particular should avoid wearing shorts and
            sleeveless garments.

            Public displays of affection are not socially acceptable.
            Money

            The currency is the taka (BDT). Credit cards are becoming more widely accepted; however,
            exercise caution when using them. Incidents of credit card fraud have been reported at
            automated banking machines (ABMs) and with merchants in Dhaka. Traveller\'s cheques can
            be exchanged at banks and at the airport in Dhaka. U.S. dollar traveller\'s cheques are

            Naturalized Canadians do not automatically lose their Belarusian citizenship and are
            subject to Belarusian laws regarding citizenship and military service.
            Identification

            Always carry your passport, visa and migration card as you may be asked to prove your

            Homosexual activity is legal but is not widely accepted in Belarusian society.
            Driving laws

            An International Driving Permit is required.

            When travelling by private vehicle, you are required to show ownership documents or a
            "power of attorney" letter at border crossings. These documents must be translated into
            Belarusian and certified at a Belarusian embassy. Third-party car insurance is mandatory
            and can only be purchased upon entry into Belarus.

            Drivers of foreign vehicles must pay a fee to use Belarusian highways. Payments are
            collected at border checkpoints and vary according to the length of stay. Tolls are
            collected on major highways and payment is required in a foreign currency (euro, U.S.
            dollar, or Russian ruble).

            Vehicles must have their lights on at all times from November 1 to March 31.

            There is zero tolerance for driving under the influence of alcohol.
            Money

            The currency is the Belarusian ruble (BYB/BYR).

            Credit cards are accepted by many hotels and stores, especially in Minsk. However,
            beware of credit-card fraud. Automated banking machines (ABMs) are available in major
            cities to withdraw rubles. Traveller\'s cheques are not accepted for payment but can be
            exchanged at a bank for rubles.

            You must pay for goods and services in Belarusian rubles. The use of foreign currency in
            cash transactions is prohibited; you can face arrest if you attempt to buy an item with
            currency other than Belarusian rubles. Exchange foreign currency at government-licensed
            booths only. A valid passport must be presented to purchase foreign currency.

            When crossing one of the external border control points of the European Union (EU), you
            must make a declaration to customs upon entry or exit if you have at least â‚¬10,000 or
            the equivalent in other currencies. The sum can be in cash, cheques, money orders,
            traveller\'s cheques or any other convertible assets. This does not apply if you are
            travelling within the EU or in transit to a non-EU country. For more information on the

            Illegal drugs

            Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are strict. Convicted
            offenders can expect jail sentences and heavy fines.
            Road travel

            You must be at least 18 years of age to drive a car in Belgium. An International Driver
            Permit (IDP) is recommended for visitors.

            A Canadian driver\'s licence and an IDP are no longer valid once you have obtained
            residence status in Belgium. Before it expires, you may exchange your driver\'s licence
            from the provinces of Alberta, New Brunswick, Ontario or Quebec for a Belgian driver\'s
            licence in the Belgian municipality where you reside.

            If you hold a driver\'s licence from another province, you should check with provincial
            licence authorities whether reciprocal recognition with Belgium has been established. To
            obtain a Belgian driver\'s licence, you must pass courses and tests, and expect to wait
            six months to a year to be able to drive legally and unaccompanied.

            Speeding causes many accidents. Strict laws are in place to improve traffic safety.
            Speed traps, cameras and unmarked vehicles are in operation throughout the country.
            Fines for exceeding the speed limit are very high and police can collect them on the
            spot. Vehicles may be impounded for failure to pay.

            Penalties for drinking and driving are strict. The legal blood alcohol limit is 0.05
            percent. Convicted offenders can expect heavy fines, and driver\'s licences may be
            confiscated immediately.

            The use of a cellular telephone while driving is prohibited, unless fitted with a
            hands-free device.

            whether it has been processed or not, cannot be owned or removed from the country
            without a government permit or a receipt from a licensed shop. All souvenirs are subject
            to the National Trophy Law, and travellers must present a receipt from a licensed store
            upon departure. It is strictly prohibited to remove elephant hair, ivory and rhinoceros
            horn products.

            the penal code is applicable to Muslims and non-Muslims.

            Immigration regulations are strict. Foreign workers who overstay their visas face harsh
            penalties, including jail sentences and caning. If you are working in Brunei, closely

            Political activism (including the dissemination of printed materials), protests,
            demonstrations and unauthorized assemblies are not tolerated in Burma.

            Freedom of speech and political activities are highly circumscribed, and the Burmese
            government is very sensitive to any expression of opposition to its rule. Foreigners
            criticizing the regime in public may be arrested or detained.

            You must show your passport and valid visa at the airport, train stations and hotels.

            Customs officials strictly limit what is brought into the country. Customs regulations
            are restrictive and rigorously enforced. Baggage may be searched upon arrival. It is
            illegal to enter or exit Burma with religious materials. Foreign currency in excess of
            US$10,000 must be declared upon arrival; failure to do so could result in imprisonment.
            In the past, importation of communications equipment such as mobile phones and laptop
            computers has been restricted. Laptop computers have been taken from tourists and held
            at the airport until their departure. Customs regulations on prohibited imports and
            exports are often unclear and can change. Further advice regarding imports and exports
            should be sought from the nearest Embassy or Consulate of the Republic of the Union of
            Myanmar.

            A permit is required to purchase or possess cultural or archaeological artifacts. It is
            illegal to export gems. Foreigners have been arrested, searched and imprisoned for

            Photography of scenes or people that could be considered politically sensitive such as
            military installations, security personnel or demonstrations is prohibited. Offenders
            could be arrested, deported, and have their equipment confiscated.

            Missionary activities and the importation of religious materials are illegal without the
            written permission of the Burmese authorities.

            Homosexual activity is illegal.

            avoid offending local sensitivities.
            Money

            The currency is the kyat (MMK). U.S. currency is widely accepted; however, only new and
            undamaged bank notes are accepted. Other foreign currencies are not normally accepted.
            Foreign Exchange Certificates (FECs), which have the same face value as the U.S. dollar,
            are issued by the Burmese government. FECs can be exchanged for MMKs or used in place of
            cash to pay for goods and services where FECs are the accepted form of payment, although
            such places are increasingly rare. There are a few official currency exchange offices in
            Yangon, including one at the Yangon International Airport. It is illegal to exchange
            currency at unauthorized locations. Neither FECs nor MMKs can be converted to any other
            currency.

            Carry enough cash to cover all of your expenses while in Burma. Credit cards are rarely
            accepted. Debit cards and traveller\'s cheques are not accepted. There are no

            driving licence. The same applies for riding motorcycles; an International Driving
            Permit with a motorcycle endorsement must be exchanged for a Cambodian motorcycle
            licence. A fee of US$32 is charged for the exchange. Helmets are mandatory for
            motorcycle drivers and passengers, but many helmets do not meet international safety
            standards. Ensure your medical insurance will cover you when riding as a driver or
            passenger.

            A permit is required to purchase or possess cultural or archaeological artefacts.

            The sexual exploitation of minors is a serious offence in Cambodia and is subject to
            harsh penalties. Canadians may also be subject to criminal proceedings in Canada for
            acts of this nature committed while abroad. Consult our publication entitled Child Sex
            Tourism: It\'s a Crime for further information on the risks of committing this form of

            Commercial surrogacy

            Commercial surrogacy is illegal in Cambodia, carrying penalties including imprisonment
            and/or fines. If you are visiting Cambodia for the purposes of commercial surrogacy
            arrangements, you should seek independent legal advice before entering into any
            agreement. If you have already entered into such an arrangement, you should also seek
            advice from a local lawyer on how this legislation could affect your situation and, in
            particular, on any exit requirements.
            Culture

            Dress conservatively, behave discreetly and respect religious and social traditions to

            people in uniform. Always ask permission before photographing individuals. An
            International Driving Permit is required for visits of up to one year in Cameroon. A
            Canadian licence alone is not acceptable. If you intend to drive in Cameroon for more
            than one year, you will require a Cameroonian driver\'s licence. To obtain a Cameroonian
            driver\'s licence from local authorities, you are required to present your Canadian
            driver\'s licence to the Delegation of Public Transport in your town of residence. The
            process usually takes only 24 hours.
            Money

            The currency is the African Financial Community CFA franc (or XAF bank code), which is
            also used in Chad, the Central African Republic, Congo, Gabon and Equatorial Guinea. The
            West African CFA franc is not valid in Cameroon, and cannot be used or exchanged. The
            economy is cash-based.

            Euros and U.S. dollars are accepted in major stores and hotels. Credit cards are rarely
            accepted outside major international hotels. VISA cash advance, money wire-transfer and
            automated banking machine (ABM) cash services are available at major banks. There are no
            American Express offices.

            Money transfer out of Cameroon is regulated, and you must obtain authorization from the
            Ministry of Finance for any such transaction. Transferring funds through a bank is
            time-consuming, and charges are levied. Traveller\'s cheques can only be cashed at two
            major hotels in YaoundÃ© (the Hilton and Mont FÃ©bÃ©) and in banks. Due to forgeries and
            recent robberies, banks and hotels will cash traveller\'s cheques only if they are
            accompanied by the original purchase receipt. Whereas Canadian dollars are accepted in
            some financial institutions and exchange bureaus, Canadian-currency travellers\' cheques
            are generally not accepted.

            High-quality counterfeit new 10,000 CFA franc banknotes have been discovered in
            circulation in CFA franc zone countries. You should avoid offers of large amounts of
            banknotes in exchange for foreign currency from anyone other than a reputable exchange
            bureau.

            Business travellers who wish to establish a presence in Cameroon should first employ the
            services of a local agent. Caution should be exercised when pursuing venture capital and
            licensing arrangements. Business people interested in opportunities in Cameroon are
            encouraged to contact the commercial section at the High Commission of Canada in
            YaoundÃ© for information.

            Imports and exports

            Local customs authorities may enforce strict regulations concerning the temporary import
            or export of items such as firearms, spear guns, medications, agricultural products, and
            animals (including sea turtle products). Note that anything delivering a projectile is

            (VISA, the French Carte bleue) and traveller\'s cheques are accepted only in major
            hotels in Bangui (Sofitel, Central Hotel and Somba Hotel). It is recommended that
            traveller\'s cheques be issued in euros.

            The exchange rate for cash is much lower than for traveller\'s cheques, but the banks

            The currency is the Central African Franc (CFA) which is also used in Cameroon, Central
            African Republic, Congo, Gabon and Equatorial Guinea. There are no import restrictions
            on local or foreign currencies, provided they are declared upon arrival. The export of
            local currency is prohibited and the export of foreign currency is limited to the amount
            declared upon arrival. Proof of entry of money must be processed through one of the
            local commercial banks.

            There are currently no automated banking machines (ABMs) in Chad. Credit cards are
            accepted only at the two major hotels in N\'Djamena and at Air France, the major

            with caution. Small amounts of local currency can be negotiated on major credit cards
            from several banks. Canadian currency and Canadian dollar traveller\'s cheques are not

            Laws

            To combat high levels of pollution in winter, restrictions on driving in central
            Santiago (within the ring road) are imposed from June to September. The last two digits
            of the licence plate number determine which days of the month a vehicle cannot be
            driven. These lists are published in newspapers. Temporary bans may be imposed on up to
            60 percent of city traffic when levels of pollution are extremely high.

            An International Driving Permit is recommended.
            Money

            The currency is the Chilean peso (CLP). U.S. dollars (but not Canadian dollars) are
            easily exchanged across the country. Purchases in U.S. dollars can only be done in
            certain stores in Santiago. Credit cards are usually accepted in hotels and restaurants
            in major tourist and business destinations, but they are often not accepted in locally
            owned small hotels and restaurants, including in Santiago. For convenience, carry
            traveller\'s cheques in U.S. currency.

            Canadian business travellers have been detained and had their passports confiscated as a
            result of business disputes with their Chinese counterparts. Seek legal advice from
            professionals in China, as well as in Canada, before proceeding with business agreements
            or arrangements. Ensure that all documents are translated so that conditions, terms and
            limitations are understood. Disputes are often costly and prolonged. Consult the website
            of the Government of Canada for more information about Doing Business with China.

            Canadian and international driving licences are not recognized in China. Foreigners must
            hold a foreigner residence permit and meet local requirements to obtain a Chinese
            driver\'s licence.

            Travel near military installations is restricted.

            Carefully consider the implications of driving in China. Foreigners driving in China
            face harsh penalties if they are involved in an accident. Police officers have the right
            to detain foreigners suspected of being responsible for road accidents until their case
            is closed, which can take years. It is not uncommon for foreigners to be blamed for
            accidents even though they are not at fault.

            There are absolute prohibitions against arms, drugs, and plant or animal products
            considered infested with disease or pests. There are also restrictions on the entry of
            printed matter, film, photos, videotapes and CDs considered detrimental to the interests
            of China.

            Canadians who intend to reside in China are advised that only one pet (dog or cat) per
            person can be imported. A Canadian animal health inspection certificate and vaccination
            certificate should be stamped by your local office of the Canadian Food Inspection
            Agency. Animals without the proper documentation will be held in quarantine at the port
            of arrival and could be destroyed if the proper documentation is not provided.

            There are restrictions on certain religious activities, such as preaching, distributing
            literature and associating with unapproved religious groups, including some Christian,
            Buddhist and Muslim organizations. The Falun Gong movement has been banned in China.
            Participants in Falun Gong activities or Falun Gong-related demonstrations are subject
            to legal action that may include detention, deportation, arrest and imprisonment.

            Photography of military installations or government buildings may result in a penalty.
            Seek permission from local authorities before taking photographs.
            Teaching English

            There are many opportunities for teaching English in China. However, make sure you are
            well informed before signing a contract. Ensure that the contract specifies the maximum
            number of classroom hours per day and per week, maximum work days per week, and vacation
            periods. Canadians teaching in China, particularly at newly established private
            secondary schools and private English training centres, have often found their employers
            unable or unwilling to honour contract terms or to assist in obtaining Chinese
            employment visas and other permits required for foreigners to teach lawfully in China.
            If you are travelling to China to work or study, you may be required to possess medical
            insurance (coverage of 400,000 renminbi). Verify this stipulation with the school or
            employer prior to arriving in China. It is illegal to work on a tourist (L) visa or on a
            working (Z) visa linked to a company other than your employer. Canadian citizens have
            been detained and forced to leave the country for working illegally.
            Money

            The currency is the renminbi (RMB). The basic unit of currency is the yuan. Counterfeit
            renminbi are relatively common, especially in southern China. It is illegal to use
            foreign currency. Exchange foreign currency at officially approved facilities only.
            Traveller\'s cheques can be exchanged at most hotels. Generally only international
            hotels and some larger shops accept international credit cards. Some Chinese banks will
            provide cash advances using credit card accounts, but they may charge for the service.
            It is possible to use bank cards to draw on your Canadian bank account at an increasing
            number of automated banking machines, especially in urban areas.

            Illegal drugs

            Sentences for drug-related offences are severe. Monitor your luggage closely at all
            times. Never transport other people\'s packages or change money for strangers.
            Laws

            Colombian law prohibits travellers from bringing firearms into Colombia. Illegal
            importation or possession of firearms may result in lengthy prison sentences.

            It is also prohibited to export certain cultural artifacts.

            It is a serious criminal offence to have sex with minors in Colombia. Conviction may
            result in a lengthy prison sentence.

            In the event of a car accident, the drivers involved must remain at the scene and not
            move their vehicles until the authorities arrive. Failure to do so may result in
            problems with Colombian law enforcement.

            An international driving permit is required.
            Money

            The currency is the Colombian peso (COP). Canadian traveller\'s cheques and cash are not
            accepted in Colombia; however, U.S. currency and traveller\'s cheques are widely
            accepted. Colombian automated banking machines (ABMs) accept most Canadian bank cards,
            making it possible to withdraw Colombian pesos.

            Laws

            Canada and Costa Rica are signatories to the European Convention on the Transfer of
            Sentenced Persons, which enables a Canadian imprisoned in Costa Rica to request to be
            transferred to Canada to complete the sentence in a Canadian prison. The transfer
            requires the agreement of both Canadian and Costa Rican authorities.

            If you violate Costa Rica\'s laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested or
            imprisoned.

            Costa Rican immigration authorities state that all foreigners must carry original
            identification documents; however, local authorities will accept photocopies as long as
            the original documents are accessible.

            It is illegal to photograph official buildings. Verify with local authorities before
            taking photos.

            The Costa Rican government is actively trying to discourage sex tourism. Soliciting the
            services of a minor for sexual purposes is illegal in Costa Rica and is punishable by
            imprisonment.

            Traffic enforcement is the responsibility of the transit police (dial 2222 9330 or 2222
            9245). Transit officers often perform roadside inspection of vehicles and request the
            driver\'s licence, vehicle registration and insurance documents. Traffic fines are not
            supposed to be collected on site. Travellers involved in driving accidents should call
            911 to notify authorities of the accident. Do not move the vehicle until advised to do
            so by the police.
            Rentals

            Terms and conditions of car rentals in Costa Rica are unlike most contracts in North
            America. You should carefully review contracts and ensure that you have appropriate
            insurance coverage, including mandatory liability coverage. Many driving situations can
            nullify insurance.
            Money

            The currency is the Costa Rican colÃ³n (CRC). To avoid complications, carry U.S. dollars
            or colones. It is advisable to exchange money at registered banks and exchange offices.
            Credit cards are widely accepted. Credit card fraud is a growing problem.

            It is extremely difficult to exchange Canadian currency and traveller\'s cheques in
            Canadian dollars in Costa Rica. The maximum amount of traveller\'s cheques that may be
            cashed at one time is $500. Access to cash via automated banking machines (ABMs) is
            available in major cities; only local currency can be withdrawn.

            Art objects purchased in CÃ´te d\'Ivoire must be accompanied by an export permit
            provided by the MusÃ©e National (national museum).

            An International Driving Permit is recommended.
            Money

            The currency is the African Financial Community franc (XOF). Credit cards are accepted
            at major hotels, some restaurants and some shops. Most commercial establishments and
            banks do not accept travellers\' cheques, either in U.S. dollars or in euros. Automated
            teller machines are available in Abidjan and most major cities. Money transfer services
            (such as Western Union and MoneyGram) are also available.

            Canadian and Croatian authorities.
            Dual citizenship

            Although dual citizenship is formally recognized, the police have been known to ignore a
            Croatian\'s second nationality. You should travel using your Canadian passport and
            present yourself as Canadian to foreign authorities at all times. Dual citizens are
            strongly advised to contact the nearest Croatian embassy or consulate well before
            departure in order to seek advice on any required administrative procedures. Failure to
            do so may also subject dual Canadian-Croatian citizens to national obligations, such as
            taxes. See Travelling as a dual citizen for more information.
            Illegal drugs

            Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are strict. Convicted
            offenders can expect jail sentences and heavy fines.
            Driving laws

            An International Driving Permit is recommended.

            Seat belt use is mandatory, as is the use of car seats for infants. Children under 12
            years of age are not allowed to sit in the front passenger seat.

            The use of a cellular telephone while driving is prohibited, unless the phone is fitted
            with a hands-free device.

            The use of headlights is required when driving during winter (from the last weekend in
            October until the last weekend in March)--even during daytime--as well as during fog and
            other inclement weather.

            Motorists must wear a fluorescent vest when attending to a car breakdown along the road.

            When driving, a vehicle coming from the right has the right of way, unless otherwise
            indicated. Right turns at red lights are prohibited. Failure to respect these laws may
            result in fines.

            Penalties for drinking and driving are strict. Police undertake routine spot checks.
            Convicted offenders can expect heavy fines and jail sentences. The legal blood alcohol
            limit is 0.05 percent, but there is zero tolerance for driving under the influence of
            alcohol when a motorist or boat operator is involved in an accident. In the event that
            an accident causes serious injury or death, police will take blood samples to test
            alcohol levels. You are advised to seek legal counsel immediately if you are charged
            following an accident.
            Money

            The currency is the Croatian kuna (HRK).

            All major Western currencies are easily exchanged for local currency. Keep receipts to
            reconvert kuna to foreign currency. Credit cards and traveller\'s cheques are accepted
            by most banks and hotels. Automated banking machines are widely available in urban
            centres.

            When crossing one of the external border control points of the European Union (EU), you
            must make a declaration to customs upon entry or exit if you have at least â‚¬10,000 or
            the equivalent in other currencies. The sum can be in cash, cheques, money orders,
            traveller\'s cheques or any other convertible assets. This does not apply if you are
            travelling within the EU or in transit to a non-EU country. For more information on the
            EU legislation and links to EU countries\' sites, visit the European Commission\'s Cash

        <item>Laws

            Canadian consular officials may be accompanied by Cuban authorities during visits with
            Canadians who have been arrested or detained.

            Under the Cuban judicial system, charges are not laid until the investigation is
            complete, and the accused may be jailed during the entire period of investigation.
            Although Cuba retains the death penalty, to date it has never been applied in the case
            of a foreign offender.

            Crimes such as drug trafficking, assault, sexual assault, and assisting in illegal
            migration of people are punishable by long prison sentences. Drinking and driving is
            against the law. The blood alcohol content limit for drivers in Cuba has been set at .04
            percent (40 mg of alcohol per 100 ml of blood).

            Avoid military zones and any other restricted or heavily guarded areas. These are not
            always identified. Photographing military or police installations or personnel, or
            harbour, rail and airport facilities, is forbidden.

            All electronic devices with Global Positioning System technology, including cellular
            telephones, are illegal and may be confiscated upon entry to Cuba.

            Traffic accidents are a frequent cause of arrest and detention of Canadians in Cuba.
            Accidents resulting in death or injury are treated as crimes, and the onus is on the
            driver to prove innocence. Regardless of the nature of the accident, it can take five
            months to a year for a case to go to trial. In most cases, the driver will not be
            allowed to leave Cuba until the trial has taken place. In some cases, the driver will be
            imprisoned during this delay.
            Vehicle rentals

            Be cautious when renting a vehicle in Cuba. Although insurance is offered, coverage
            differs from that in Canada. Contract agreements do not cover occasional drivers;
            therefore, the signatory is responsible for all people driving the vehicle. If you are
            found to be at fault in any way in an accident, rental agencies will nullify your
            coverage and seek damages to cover the cost of repairs, which can be very high.

            Avoid renting scooters, as thieves target them and you may be responsible for the cost
            of their replacement.

            Rental agencies are government-controlled and can prevent you from leaving the country
            unless they receive payment.
            Sex tourism

            Cuba is actively working to prevent child sex tourism, and a number of tourists,
            including Canadians, have been convicted of offences related to the corruption of minors
            aged 16 and under. Prison sentences range from 7 to 25 years. Release on bail before
            trial is unlikely.
            Dual citizenship

            Under Cuban law, the Government of Canada cannot provide consular services to Canadian
            nationals or to permanent residents of Canada with Cuban citizenship.
            Boat traffic

            The U.S. government closely monitors boat traffic in the Straits of Florida. Officials
            will seize any vessel without a licence from the Office of Foreign Assets Control if
            they believe it is headed for Cuba. Canadians who dock their Canadian-registered boats
            in Florida are subject to these measures, whereas those Canadian boats simply en route
            to Cuba via the U.S. will be exempt. However, expect to be thoroughly searched and
            questioned if you are in the latter category.
            Imports and exports

            Articles prohibited from entry into Cuba include drugs, explosives, pornographic
            material, literature considered subversive, perishable food items, radio transmission
            equipment, wireless microphones, radio and TV receivers differing from household models,
            global positioning systems (GPS), satellite receiver antennas and stations, air
            conditioners, and small appliances that draw heavily on electricity. Such items are
            routinely seized on arrival without compensation.

            Cuban customs officials may also seize any imported item that they do not consider to be
            for the tourist\'s personal use.

            Cuban customs may apply steep tariffs for travellers whose personal baggage exceeds 30
            kg or who are carrying more than 10 kg of medication.

            Donations of any type, whether by individuals, organizations or businesses, must be
            coordinated through the Embassy of Cuba in Canada.

            You may export up to 20 cigars from Cuba without documentation or up to 50 cigars if
            they are in the original container, closed and sealed with the official hologram. If
            exceeding that amount, you must also provide a guarantee of origin certificate. Failure
            to comply with this regulation will lead to the seizure of the cigars without
            compensation. Art objects (including artifacts and paintings) purchased in Cuba must be
            accompanied by an export permit (usually provided by state-owned galleries). Otherwise,
            items must be registered with the Registro Nacional de Bienes Culturales, Calle 17, No.
            1009 e/10 y 12, Vedado, tel.: 53-7-833-9658.

            It is forbidden to leave Cuba with illegally purchased lobsters. Authorities can impose
            heavy fines and require the offender to pay before leaving the country.

            For detailed information on import and export requirements, please consult the Cuban
            Customs Administration.
            Black market

            Travellers may be approached and offered black-market goods, such as cigars, or asked to
            change dollars for Cuban convertible pesos. Engaging in black-market transactions is
            illegal and can lead to difficulties with the Cuban authorities. Never transport
            packages for strangers. Pack all luggage yourself.
            Marriage

            Marriage to a Cuban citizen does not guarantee your spouse immediate access to Canada.
            The immigration process takes at least 10 months, and you must initiate the sponsorship
            in Canada. For additional information, consult Citizenship and Immigration Canada.

            Marrying a Cuban does not automatically entitle you to live with your spouse in Cuba,
            even for just a few days. To be able to stay in your spouse\'s residence, you must have
            a personal visa so that you are properly registered with local authorities. Your spouse
            can be fined or jailed if you do not follow the rules. Cubans accompanying foreign
            visitors, especially in bars and hotels, may be asked for identification papers and
            denied entry.

            Canadians wishing to marry a Cuban in Cuba may visit the Web site of the Embassy of Cuba
            in Canada for more information on required documents and procedures.

            Two Canadians who have never been married before need to present the following documents
            to be married in Cuba:

            a) valid passport; and

            b) the tourist card obtained upon arrival.

            If either of the Canadians has been married before, in addition to a valid passport and
            tourist card, he or she must produce the following documents:

            a) if divorced, the certificate of divorce;

            b) if widowed, the certificate of marriage and the spouse\'s death certificate.

            Furthermore, these certificates must be legalized and authenticated by Canadian
            authorities, translated into typewritten Spanish, without errors or corrections, and
            then forwarded to the Cuban embassy or a Cuban consulate in Canada for legalization and
            authentication.
            Money

            Cuba has two official currencies: the Cuban convertible peso (CUC) and the national peso
            (moneda nacional or MN). Transactions involving foreigners almost always take place in
            CUC. However, visitors should familiarize themselves with the moneda nacional, since it
            is a common scam for merchants to give change in moneda nacional instead of CUC. The CUC
            is worth substantially more than the MN.
            Accessing funds in Cuba

            Canadians often encounter problems accessing funds while in Cuba. Debit cards and
            Canadian money transfers are not accepted. Additionally, Canadian money transfers are
            not accepted by Western Union in Cuba. Credit cards are not widely accepted; in
            particular, those issued by American financial institutions, such as American Express
            cards, and some credit cards issued by certain Canadian financial institutions
            affiliated with American banks, are not accepted. Other credit cards are generally
            accepted at major establishments such as state-run hotels and restaurants and
            international resort chains. Private restaurants (paladares) and private guest houses
            (casas particulares) do not accept credit cards of any kind. Credit card cash advances
            (in CUCs) may be obtained at banks, hotels or Cadeca exchange houses.

            Automated banking machines (ABMs) are rare and do not always work in Cuba. In Havana,
            cash advances in CUCs from Visa cards can be obtained from the ABMs located in the
            Miramar Trade Centre and in some hotels. In Varadero, ABMs are located in the Plaza
            America and at banks. If you use an ABM, do so during business hours at a location
            inside a bank or large commercial building. Leave copies of your card numbers with a
            family member in case of emergency.

            Most foreign currencies can be exchanged at Cadeca exchange houses, found in Cuba\'s
            international airports and in urban areas, as well as in banks and major hotels.
            Canadian currency (cash and traveller\'s cheques) may be exchanged for CUC without fees.
            American Express traveller\'s cheques are accepted at certain banks. Keep receipts for
            traveller\'s cheques separate. Australian dollars cannot be exchanged anywhere on the
            island. Exchange of U.S. currency is possible, but is subject to an additional fee.

            It is against Cuban law to remove CUCs from Cuba. They can be exchanged for U.S. dollars
            (and Canadian dollars, if available) at international airports before leaving the
            country. It is not possible to exchange CUCs outside of Cuba.

            The currency is the Congolese franc (or CDF bank code). Payments can be made in foreign
            currency, particularly U.S. dollars. Merchants and foreign exchange dealers do, however,
            require that foreign currency be in good condition (not torn) and recently issued
            (American bills with large heads), due to the amount of counterfeit currency in
            circulation.

            Credit cards and travellers\' cheques are not generally accepted, apart from major
            institutions such as the Memling Hotel and the Grand Hotel in Kinshasa. Keep and

            image, film or audio-visual recording considered contrary to accepted standards of
            behaviour. The prohibition on the use of drugs must be respected. Consumption of alcohol

        <item>Illegal drugs

            Persons convicted of buying, selling, carrying or using any type or quantity of drug are
            subject to strict penalties. Judicial processes may last several years (during which
            accused individuals are normally detained) and could lead to long prison sentences in
            harsh conditions.
            Laws

            Dominican law stipulates that victims of crime (including foreigners) are responsible
            for reporting incidents to police. Victims who wish to pursue prosecution or seek
            compensation must retain Dominican legal counsel to file a formal complaint to the
            police and to pursue the case through the justice system. The official language of the
            Dominican Republic is Spanish. You should expect all documents to be in Spanish and not
            English or French.

            An International Driving Permit is required.
            Dual citizenship

            Dual citizenship is legally recognized. However, in the judicial system, citizens of
            Dominican origin are considered Dominican citizens. Therefore, Canadian consular
            officials may be limited in their ability to provide consular services.
            Real estate

            Many Canadians have reported financial problems and complications involving time-share
            arrangements and other property investment activities. Exercise caution whenever
            approached by time-share representatives as pressure sales techniques are used. Do not
            reveal personal information or provide your credit card unless you are certain you wish
            to make a purchase.

            Before making any real estate or land investment, consult Dominican and Canadian lawyers
            with relevant experience, and exercise extreme caution. Land deeds should be carefully
            verified. Ensure that constant vigilance of land will take place, as there have been
            several instances of disputed land occupation in the absence of the alleged owner. The
            Embassy of Canada in Santo Domingo cannot intervene in legal matters, and cannot give
            legal advice regarding land purchases or disputes.
            Marriage

            Marriages legally performed in compliance with the laws of the Dominican Republic are
            recognized in Canada. For information on required documentation and procedures, contact
            the Embassy of the Dominican Republic in Ottawa.
            Money

            Upon departure from the Dominican Republic, you cannot export more than US$10,000 or its
            equivalent in another currency.

            The currency is the Dominican peso (DOP). U.S. dollars are widely accepted, but Canadian
            currency is not. Canadian currency and traveller\'s cheques can be exchanged at most
            commercial banks and exchange booths or offices (casas de cambio) and in resort areas
            and major tourist hotels. Currency should be exchanged only at banks, official exchange
            booths and casas de cambio.

        <item>Illegal drugs

            Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are severe. Individuals
            may be found guilty by association if they have criminal associates. Drivers should not
            accept hitchhikers, as they could be held responsible for them as well as for the
            content of their luggage. Monitor your luggage at all times when travelling, especially
            at airports, and never agree to carry items for another person.
            Laws

            It is a legal requirement in Ecuador to carry identification at all times.

        <item>Laws

            The state of emergency (Emergency Law), which had been in effect since 1981, was lifted
            on May 31, 2012. While this represents an increase in civil liberties, you are advised
            to exercise restraint and common sense during the transition period.

            The use of drugs and open consumption of alcohol (other than in licensed facilities such
            as hotels and restaurants) are prohibited. Transgressions could be punished by detention
            or other penalties.

            Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are strict. Convicted
            offenders can expect jail sentences and heavy fines. Capital punishment is a sentencing
            option for certain drug-related crimes.

            Photography of bridges, canals, including the Suez Canal, government, police and embassy
            buildings and vehicles, as well as military personnel and establishments is prohibited.

            An International Driving Permit (IDP) is recommended.
            Customs

            Strict duties apply on the importation of expensive electronics, including video and
            photographic equipment, laptops, and computer software and hardware. Such equipment
            should be for personal use and you should list it (model and serial number) and check it
            upon arrival and departure, in which case no duty will be collected. Appropriate permits
            and authorizations are required for the commercial importation of any type of
            electronics. It is prohibited to export any antiquity or any item older than 100 years
            without a licence. Contact the Embassy of the Arab Republic of Egypt in Ottawa for
            further information regarding customs requirements.
            Forced marriages

            There are reports of Canadian citizens being forced into marriage without their prior
            knowledge or consent. For more information about forced marriages, please consult our
            Marriage Overseas FAQs and our publication entitled Her Own Way: A Woman\'s Guide to

            Dual citizenship

            You may be considered an Egyptian citizen if you were born in Egypt or were born outside
            Egypt to an Egyptian father. Consular assistance by the Embassy of Canada is unlikely to
            be permitted by the Egyptian authorities and may therefore be extremely limited.

            Egyptian-Canadian men may be subject to military service when in Egypt. In order to be
            exempted, before leaving Egypt dual citizens are required to present many documents,
            among them a document of discharge due to dual citizenship. This document does not
            necessarily provide an exemption; getting this document may be a drawn-out process that
            could affect your departure date; and the Canadian government has no jurisdiction in the
            process. In the end, military service for Egyptian men is the decision of the Egyptian
            government. You should contact the Egyptian embassy or consulate in Canada before
            travelling.

            See Travelling as a dual citizen for more information.
            Culture

            The work week is Sunday through Thursday.

            Overt public displays of intimate affection are frowned upon in Egyptian culture.
            Demonstrations of homosexuality have been deemed an affront to public morals, and some
            Egyptian homosexuals have been jailed.

            Islamic practices and beliefs are adhered to in the country\'s customs, laws and
            regulations. Exercise common sense and discretion in dress and behaviour. Dress
            conservatively: for women, knee-length or longer dresses and long sleeves are
            preferable, and men should not wear shorts outside tourist areas. Respect religious and
            social traditions to avoid offending local sensitivities.
            Money

            The currency is the Egyptian pound (EGP).

            A maximum of EGP 5,000 can be brought into or taken out of Egypt.

            Traveller\'s cheques and foreign currency are easily exchanged in hotels and banks. U.S.
            dollars are preferred, particularly at tourist sites. It has become common practice for
            some travel agents and tour operators to request that payment be made in U.S. cash only.

            Major credit cards are accepted in larger stores and for larger purchases, but many
            merchants will accept only cash or may charge a fee for payment by credit card.
            MasterCard may be refused in banks, hotels, shops, and by travel agents because of its

            You must obtain approval from the El Salvador Department of Foreign Affairs to attend
            international conferences. If permission is granted, you may participate only as an
            observer, not as an activist or lobbyist for a particular political position.

            To own or carry a firearm, you require a permit issued in El Salvador. Carrying
            unregistered firearms is punishable by a prison sentence.

            Salvadoran authorities will accept a valid Canadian driver\'s licence if it is presented
            with a valid Canadian passport. However, an International Driving Permit is recommended
            for travel between countries.
            Money

            The official currency is the U.S. dollar (USD). Although the colÃ³n (SVC) still exists,
            it is not in circulation. Traveller\'s cheques in U.S. dollars can be changed in major
            hotels and banks when presented with a valid passport. Ask for small denominations ($1,
            $5, $10), since US$50 and US$100 bills are not widely accepted and can expose you to
            greater risk of robbery.

            The import or possession of camouflage clothing, large knives, binoculars, firearms, or
            similar items may be deemed suspicious by authorities. These items could be confiscated
            and you could be detained. Satellite phones are legally permissible, but not all
            immigration officials may be aware of this. If stopped, make an effort to speak to a
            higher authority, or if you are forced to leave the satellite phone with an official,
            ensure that you receive a receipt or some other identification of the confiscator to

            officials to provide consular services. You should travel using your Canadian passport
            and present yourself as Canadian to foreign authorities at all times. See Travelling as
            a dual citizen for more information.

            in a vehicle near a restricted area, no matter the reason.

            Tourist souvenirs are often copies of Ethiopian antiques or religious paraphernalia. It
            is important to have a proper receipt that clearly indicates that a purchased item is a
            souvenir and not authentic, as the exportation of real antiques or religious items is
            not permitted. Receipts should be carried on your person when travelling. It should be
            noted, however, that even upon presenting such documents, items purchased for

            referred to as 3 a.m. Julian time).

            The Ethiopian highlands are predominantly Orthodox Christian. There is fasting in this
            region each Wednesday and Friday, and during Lent. Primarily vegetarian dishes are
            available during this period (except in large hotels).

            Always obtain permission from religious authorities before visiting churches.

            US$3,000 (or its equivalent in any convertible foreign currency) unless also carrying a
            bank advice certifying the purchase of the foreign currency or a customs declaration
            form completed upon entry. Even the provision of such documents may not safeguard you
            against confiscation of the extra funds, imprisonment or fines. You must declare foreign
            currencies upon arrival and may be required to present this declaration when applying
            for an exit visa.

            Exchange foreign currency at banks or official foreign exchange offices only, as

            Official exchange rates are close to black-market rates.

            Credit cards are not widely accepted except by large hotels, travel agencies, and a few
            shops and restaurants in Addis Ababa. Take hard-currency cash or traveller\'s cheques to
            Ethiopia. Traveller\'s cheques can be cashed at the Commercial Bank of Ethiopia or at
            any privately owned bank.

            Ghana\'s currency was redenominated in 2007. The new Ghanaian currency, the Ghana cedi
            (GHS), has progressively replaced the old cedi and, since January 2008, the old cedi can
            only be converted at the Bank of Ghana.

            The export of cedis is prohibited. There are no restrictions on the import and export of
            foreign currencies provided that they are declared upon arrival and exchanged for local
            currency only through banks and foreign exchange bureaus. Visitors may receive an
            Exchange Control Form T-5 on arrival; if not, travellers may request it. Foreign
            currency and all transactions made while in the country must be recorded on this form.
            This form should be safely stored; its loss can result in problems. Unused cedis must be
            spent or reconverted into foreign currency before departure. The T-5 declaration form
            must show that the monies obtained while in Ghana were from an authorized dealer in
            foreign exchange. Currency transactions with private citizens are illegal.

            Laws

            A Haitian driver\'s permit is required for vehicle operators staying more than three
            months A permit may be obtained on presentation of a valid provincial driver\'s licence
            or an International Driving Permit (IDP). For stays under three months, an IDP is

            overcrowded, unsanitary and under-resourced.

            Individual Canadians or Canadian organizations wishing to donate clothing, new or used
            material goods, personal care products or medications should contact the Embassy of the

            Most leading hotels accept major credit cards. American and Canadian travellers\'
            cheques are rarely accepted, and Canadian currency is never accepted. Canadian bank
            cards may be used to access funds from some automated banking machines (ABMs), but the
            withdrawal limit is much lower than in Canada. Haitian ABMs have been reported as
            unreliable in the past. They should not be depended upon in emergency situations. Be
            extremely vigilant when using ABMs in Haiti as there is a high risk of robbery.

            A motorway vignette (permit) is required when travelling on highways. You may purchase
            these electronic vignettes at a gas station. You must keep receipts for one year if the
            gas station does not issue stickers as proof of payment.

            Police do not collect fines on the spot for traffic violations, but they do issue a
            ticket indicating the amount of the fine, which can be paid at any post office. Police
            may retain the passport of a traveller who disputes a fine or offence. They will then
            issue a receipt and letter requesting that the traveller report to a police station. The
            passport is returned once the dispute is settled.

            There are strict regulations on the temporary import or export of items such as
            firearms, antiquities, electronic equipment, local currency, ivory, gold objects,
            pornographic materials and other prohibited materials. Non-residents are prohibited from

            A number of Canadians have been involved in marital fraud and dowry abuse in India. Some
            cases involve misuse of India\'s Dowry Prohibition Act. This law, enacted to protect
            women by making dowry demands a crime, is sometimes used to blackmail men through false
            allegations of dowry extortion. Individuals facing charges may be forced to remain in
            India until their cases have been settled or must compensate their spouses in exchange
            for the dismissal of charges. To avoid such problems, register your marriage in India
            along with a joint declaration of gifts exchanged, and consider a prenuptial agreement,

            Indonesia strictly enforces its immigration and visa requirements. Foreigners have been
            detained in Immigration Detention Centres for visa violations or overstays. Those in
            violation may be subject to substantial fines and deportation.

            Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are very strict and
            include the death penalty for serious drug offences. Suspects can be detained for
            prolonged periods, without the possibility of release on bail, while police conduct
            investigations prior to prosecution. Random drug testing of tourists throughout the
            country has resulted in several arrests.

            Gambling is illegal.

            Local customs authorities may enforce strict regulations concerning temporary
            importation or export of items such as medications and audiovisual material. Contact the
            Embassy of the Republic of Indonesia for specific information regarding customs
            requirements.

            Canadians are not permitted to drive in Indonesia on a Canadian driving licence but are
            permitted to use an international licence, which can be purchased locally. An
            International Driving Permit obtained in Canada may need to be endorsed by the local
            Indonesian licensing office.
            Culture

            In some areas, Islamic practices and beliefs are closely adhered to in local customs,
            laws and regulations. Dress conservatively, behave discreetly, and respect religious and
            social traditions to avoid offending local sensitivities.
            Money

            The currency is the rupiah (IDR). Credit cards are not widely accepted outside of large
            urban centres and tourist areas. There is a very high rate of credit and debit card
            fraud in Indonesia. Pay careful attention when your cards are being handled by others
            during payment processing. Indonesia is known for its high rate of online credit card
            fraud. Ensure that your card information (number, name, expiry date) is kept private.
            Keep all receipts and bills with a credit or debit card number secure or destroy them
            completely. Traveller\'s cheques can be exchanged at banks and larger hotels. Carry cash

            require an International Driving Permit.

            The work week is from Saturday to Thursday. However, many private companies and
            government offices are closed on Thursday.
            Illegal or restricted activities

            Possession, use or trafficking of drugs and alcohol is forbidden. Convicted offenders
            can expect very severe penalties, including capital punishment.

            People who challenge the Islamic faith or attempt to convert Muslims to another religion
            may be condemned to death.

            Avoid public displays of affection between two people of the opposite sex, especially
            between a non-Muslim man and a Muslim woman.

            Those who engage in sexual relations outside of marriage are subject to severe
            penalties, including death.

            Homosexual activity is a criminal offence. Those convicted may be sentenced to lashing,
            a prison sentence, and/or death.

            Magazines and DVDs with sexual or explicit content are forbidden.

            Photography of government and military installations--such as ports and airports and
            their surroundings--is strictly prohibited. Such sites are not always identifiable.
            Refrain from taking pictures whenever you are not at a recognized tourist site. When in
            doubt, ask for permission.

            Playing music loudly in public, including in cars, is prohibited by law.
            Religion

            Iran is an Islamic theocratic republic. A conservative interpretation of Islamic
            practices and beliefs is closely adhered to in the country\'s customs, laws, and
            regulations. Dress conservatively, behave discreetly, and respect religious and social
            traditions to avoid offending local sensitivities. Men should not wear shorts, and women
            should cover their head with a scarf and cover their arms and legs.

            Former Muslims who have converted to other religions have been subject to arrest and
            prosecution.
            Dual citizenship

            Male Iranian citizens aged 18 to 34 are required to perform military service, unless
            exempt. This requirement also applies to Iranian-Canadians, even those born in Canada.
            Iranian-Canadians aged 17 years or more will not be allowed to leave Iran without first
            having completed their military service.
            Marriage and divorce

            The Government of Canada can provide only very limited assistance if a Canadian woman
            married to an Iranian man has marital difficulties and/or encounters difficulties
            leaving Iran.

            Canadian women married to Iranian nationals who register their marriage with the Iranian
            authorities automatically become Iranian citizens and are deemed to be Iranian citizens
            according to Iranian law, even if they travel to Iran on a Canadian passport with an
            Iranian visa. Iranian immigration authorities often impound Canadian passports,
            particularly those of women who intend to reside in Iran. Women who are considered to be
            Iranian by marriage must have their husband\'s permission to travel and to leave Iran,
            even if they intend to use their Canadian passport.

            Iranian women married to Iranian nationals and divorced in Canada need to have their
            divorce certificate issued in Canada authenticated by Foreign Affairs and International
            Trade Canada in Ottawa. The divorce certificate must then be sanctioned by a court of
            justice in Iran in order to be valid under Iranian law.

            Iranian women married to Iranian nationals in Iran and divorced in Canada cannot use
            their Canadian divorce certificate for official purposes in Iran unless it is first
            authenticated by Foreign Affairs and International Trade Canada in Ottawa and properly
            sanctioned in Iran by a court of justice. A Canadian divorce certificate that is not
            sanctioned by an Iranian court would automatically be void in Iran, meaning that the
            divorce would not be recognized under Iranian law. Therefore, in Iran, an Iranian woman
            would still be considered to be married to her husband.

            In order to avoid any difficulties in Iran related to a Canadian divorce, women should
            consult both a Canadian and an Iranian lawyer before travelling to Iran.

            For more information, consult our Marriage Overseas FAQ and our publication entitled Her
            Own Way: A Woman\'s Safe-Travel Guide.
            Custody of children

            Under Iranian law, children of divorced parents--even if they were born in Canada--are
            under the sole custody of their father, regardless of what a Canadian court may decide.
            Therefore, if such children are travelling with their mother in Iran, they may encounter
            great difficulty in returning to Canada. Women in such situations should consult both a
            Canadian and an Iranian lawyer before travelling to Iran.

            In the case of divorce or of the husband\'s death, an Iranian man\'s foreign-born wife
            may renounce her Iranian citizenship. However, the couple\'s children will irrevocably
            be Iranian citizens, and will have to enter and leave Iran with an Iranian passport.

            Guardianship of children under the age of seven usually goes to the mother and is
            automatically transferred to the father when the child turns seven. In rare cases,
            Iranian courts may grant legal custody to the paternal grandfather or to the mother if a
            court determines that the father is unsuitable to raise his children. Women can only
            gain custody under these circumstances if they hold Iranian citizenship and are
            residents of Iran.

            Even if a woman is granted custody of her children, children under the age of 18 still
            need permission from their paternal grandfather or the court to leave the country. Such
            permission is also required for other activities involving legal decisions, such as
            applying for a passport.
            Canadian children of Iranian fathers

            Canadian children whose father is an Iranian national face difficulties while in Iran.
            Under Iranian law, children of a male Iranian national, including Canadian-Iranian
            nationals, are in the sole custody of their father. Children require their father\'s
            permission to leave Iran.

            Iran is not a signatory to the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International
            Child Abduction.
            Money

            The currency is the Iranian rial (IRR). The economy is exclusively cash-based. Credit
            cards and traveller\'s cheques are not accepted in Iran. Automated banking machines
            exist only for local banking by Iranians. Bring sufficient cash, preferably in U.S.
            dollars, to cover all expenses. Only crisp U.S. banknotes are accepted.

            It is strictly prohibited to take antiquities, archaeological finds or antique carpets
            out of Iraq, in accordance with the Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property
            in the Event of Armed Conflict and its first protocol.
            Dual citizenship

            Dual citizenship is not legally recognized, which may limit the ability of Canadian
            officials to provide consular services. You should travel using your Canadian passport
            and present yourself as Canadian to foreign authorities at all times. See Travelling as
            a dual citizen for more information.
            Custody

            According to Iraqi law, the child of a male Iraqi national is considered an Iraqi
            national. Even if the name of the child is written in the mother\'s foreign passport,
            Iraqi authorities may consider the child an Iraqi national and the child will require
            the father\'s permission to travel.

            Religious and social traditions

            Dress conservatively, behave discreetly, and respect religious and social traditions to

            Use common sense and discretion in dress and behaviour, particularly in Jerusalem, the
            West Bank and the Gaza Strip. People feel strongly about their customs and beliefs.
            Assaults on visitors who are travelling in cars or immodestly dressed have occurred in
            Jerusalem\'s Old City and ultra-Orthodox Jewish neighbourhoods on the Sabbath (Friday
            nights and Saturdays).

            During periods of religious holidays, such as Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur, Ramadan and
            Pesach (Passover), stay informed of the security situation, follow the advice of
            authorities, respect local customs, and monitor local news reports for changes to
            checkpoint and border-crossing hours of operation.
            Money

            A special permit-issued only to residents and members of public organizations-is
            necessary to have access to Rome city centre by car. Similar restrictions are in place
            in most city centres. Take note of street signage and abide by the Zona a Traffico
            Limitato (limited traffic zone restriction), often abbreviated as "ZTL". In the summer,

            Laws

            Foreign visitors are required to carry their passport or residency (zairyu) card at all
            times.

            Japanese regulations require that visiting foreign nationals provide detailed
            information when checking in at hotels, inns or other lodging facilities. The purpose of
            registration is to assist authorities to prevent infectious diseases and terrorism. The
            required information includes your name, address, occupation, nationality and passport
            number. Foreigners must also allow their passports to be photocopied.

            Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are strict. Convicted
            offenders can expect jail sentences and fines. In most drug cases, suspects are denied
            oral or written communication with anyone other than their lawyer or a Canadian consular
            representative. Those arrested, even for a minor offence, may be held in detention for
            weeks or months during the investigation and legal proceedings.

            You must possess an International Driving Permit and obtain Japanese insurance to drive
            in Japan.

            There is zero tolerance for driving under the influence of alcohol. Penalties are

            incarceration.

            You can bring a one-month supply of prescription medication or a two-month supply of
            non-prescription medication into Japan providing the medication does not contain
            narcotics (including codeine). The importation of certain over-the-counter and
            prescription medications used to relieve sinus and allergy symptoms is banned.

            Prescribed medication must be accompanied by the doctor\'s prescription stating the
            patient\'s full name, address, reason for use and dosage. The bearer of the medication
            may be requested to present a detailed listing of the contents of the medication. If you
            wish to bring in larger supplies of medication or bring in prescription medication that
            contains narcotics, you must apply in advance for import certification. Application
            should be made several months prior to arrival. Consult the Japanese Ministry of Health,
            Labour and Welfare for more information.

            reviewed before being signed. There have been reports that some contracts have been
            modified after the fact. Ensure all terms and conditions of employment are clearly
            stated before accepting an offer and ensure that you meet all the necessary
            requirements. The Korean government investigates the use of fraudulent documents,
            university degrees and ESL certificates. Penalties for using fraudulent documents
            include arrest, deportation and restrictions on re-entry. Be aware that written
            contracts are not binding documents. Verbal agreements often take precedence over
            written agreements. Consult our publication entitled Teaching English in Korea for more
            information.
            Money

            The currency is the won (KRW). Traveller\'s cheques are accepted at all chartered banks
            (Eunhaeng in Korean). U.S. dollar traveller\'s cheques are recommended for the best
            exchange rate. Some major banks have automated banking machines (ABMs) that accept
            international debit or credit cards. The amount allowed per withdrawal may be quite low,
            rendering the service charge disproportionately high. Most ABMs that can be used to draw
            money from Canadian bank accounts offer English instructions. Major foreign credit cards
            (Visa, MasterCard and American Express) are widely accepted by hotels and other tourist
            facilities and are generally regarded as safe to use.

            When transferring funds from Korea to Canada, a local bank will place a stamp in your
            passport stating how much was transferred, in keeping with Korea\'s Foreign Currency
            Control Act. If you are working in Korea and paying Korean income tax, you can transfer
            your entire income based on your tax payment certificate.

            offenders can expect jail sentences and heavy fines.

            Photography of military or police installations, vehicles and personnel is prohibited.
            Homosexuality

            Homosexuality is not widely accepted in Kosovo.
            Driving laws

            An International Driving Permit is recommended. Always carry identification and vehicle
            registration papers. Third-party automobile insurance is mandatory and can be purchased
            upon entry into Kosovo.

            Drivers of vehicles bearing foreign licence plates must pay for compulsory third-party
            Green Card insurance.

            Road tolls must be paid in local currency. Posted speed limits are strictly enforced.
            Money

            The currency used throughout Kosovo is the euro (EUR). The economy is largely
            cash-based. Automated banking machines (ABMs) are available in urban centres.

            Suspects as well as witnesses to incidents may be held for lengthy periods without
            access to legal counsel or consular officials. If access is granted, it may be severely
            limited by the Kuwaiti authorities. Authorities may withhold the passport of an
            individual involved in legal processes, pending resolution of the case. This could
            result in the delay of a planned departure.
            Illegal activities

            Criticism of the Emir is not permitted by Kuwaiti authorities.

            Religious proselytizing is not permitted.

            Common-law relationships, homosexual relations, adultery and prostitution are illegal
            and are subject to severe punishment.

            Penalties for possession, use and trafficking of illegal drugs are strict. Convicted
            offenders can expect heavy fines, lengthy jail sentences or even the death penalty. The
            possession of drugs, even a very small amount, could result in arrest and imprisonment.

            Possession and consumption of alcohol is illegal in Kuwait. Alcohol cannot be legally
            purchased or imported into Kuwait, and the penalties associated with the possession of
            alcohol include heavy fines, imprisonment or deportation.

            There is a zero tolerance policy regarding drinking and driving. Consequences include
            heavy fines, imprisonment or deportation.

            Importation and consumption of pork products is illegal.

            It is illegal to possess pornographic material.

            Photography of government buildings and military or industrial sites, particularly oil
            fields, is forbidden. Do not photograph people without their permission.
            Fraudulent practices

            Fraudulent practices, for example, writing cheques without sufficient funds and
            non-payment of bills, are regarded as extremely serious offences and may result in
            imprisonment and fines. Temporary release pending legal action may be granted in minor
            cases if the passport of the accused and the passport of the guarantor are surrendered
            to the authorities.
            Dress and behaviour

            Common sense and discretion should be exercised in dress and behaviour. Men and women
            should dress conservatively. Men must wear pants and a shirt in public. It is uncommon
            for Western women to cover their head in Kuwait. Dresses and skirts are permitted,
            provided they cover the shoulders and knees. Shorts and short skirts are considered
            inappropriate.

            Exercise particular care in your behaviour with others, especially officials, to avoid
            offending local sensitivities. Verbal insults and obscene gestures may be considered a
            criminal act and, if found guilty, you could face deportation, fines and/or a prison
            sentence.

            Avoid physical contact, such as holding hands, in public.
            Dual citizenship

            Dual citizenship is not legally recognized, which may limit the ability of Canadian
            officials to provide consular services. You should travel using your Canadian passport
            and present yourself as Canadian to foreign authorities at all times. See Travelling as
            a dual citizen for more information.
            Child custody

            Child custody decisions are based on Islamic law. It is extremely difficult for a
            Canadian woman, even if she is a Muslim, to obtain custody of her children through
            Kuwaiti courts. Regardless of their parents\' marital status, minor children with a
            Kuwaiti father may not leave Kuwait without his permission.
            Money

            The currency, the Kuwaiti dinar (KWD), is readily convertible to U.S. dollars. Credit
            cards and U.S. dollar traveller\'s cheques are widely accepted, and automated banking
            machines are available nationwide.

            Homosexual activity is legal but not widely accepted by Kyrgyz society.

            Photography of military installations or government buildings may result in a penalty.
            Seek permission from local authorities before taking such photographs.
            Religion

            Although the Kyrgyz Republic is a secular country, Islamic practices and beliefs are
            closely adhered to, particularly in rural areas. Dress conservatively, behave discreetly
            and respect religious and social traditions to avoid offending local sensitivities.
            Dual citizenship

            Dual citizenship is not legally recognized, which may limit the ability of Canadian

            a dual citizen for more information.
            Money

            The currency is the Kyrgyzstani som. The economy is primarily cash-based. Canadian
            currency and traveller\'s cheques are not widely accepted. Declare foreign currency upon
            entry; you cannot leave with more foreign money than you brought in. Convert Kyrgyzstani
            soms into euros or U.S. dollars before leaving the country, as you will not be able to
            do so after departure. Automated banking machines are widely available in Bishkek but
            may be limited in rural areas. Credit cards are accepted in major hotels, some
            restaurants and most banks. Due to the potential for fraud and other criminal activity,
            use credit cards with caution. Leave copies of your card numbers with a family member,
            in case of emergency.

            Non-marital sexual relationships between foreigners and Laotian citizens are against the
            law, as are various forms of cohabitation with Laotian nationals. Convictions for such
            offences can lead to prison sentences and large fines. Improper registration of a
            relationship to a Laotian national can lead to similar penalties. Permission for
            marriage or engagement to a Laotian citizen must be submitted in a formal application to
            Laotian authorities.

            You can be fined for not carrying proper identification, such as your passport, at all
            times, and for not having an entry stamp in your passport.

            Photography of government buildings and vehicles, as well as bridges, airfields, and
            military installations or personnel, is prohibited. Violators may be arrested and their
            equipment, seized.

            Laos is tolerant of a diversity of religions. However, religious proselytizing or
            distributing of religious material is strictly prohibited. Violators may be arrested or
            deported.

            An International Driving Permit is recommended.
            Culture

            Public displays of affection, such as kissing, whether between opposite or same-sex
            couples, are not considered proper or polite.

            Consult the Canadian Trade Commissioner Service if you intend to do business in Laos.
            Money

            The currency is the kip (LAK). It is not easily obtained or exchanged outside of Laos.
            U.S. dollars and Thai baht are widely accepted. There are very few automated banking
            machines in Laos that accept foreign cards, and those that do are often out of order.
            Major credit cards are accepted at some international hotels and tourist establishments.
            Cash advances can be obtained from some banks, although the bank commissions are high.
            Traveller\'s cheques can be cashed at most banks in Vientiane and other major towns.

            Canadian and Latvian authorities.
            Illegal drugs

            Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are strict. Convicted
            offenders can expect jail sentences or heavy fines.
            Road travel

            A Canadian driver\'s licence is valid in Latvia for one year. An International Driving
            Permit is recommended.

            The use of cell telephones while driving is prohibited, unless they are fitted with a
            hands-free device.

            Headlights must be on at all times and the use of seat belts is mandatory.

            Vehicles should be equipped for severe conditions and must be fitted with winter tires
            between December 1 and March 1. All vehicles must have a first-aid kit and emergency
            travel equipment (e.g. warning triangle, fire extinguisher).

            Penalties for drinking and driving are strict. The legal blood alcohol limit is 0.02 for
            drivers with less than two years of driving experience and 0.05 for others. Convicted
            offenders can expect heavy fines or jail sentences.
            Exports

            Exportation of religious materials and antiquities is subject to strict customs
            regulations. Contact the Embassy of the Republic of Latvia for specific information
            regarding customs requirements.
            Money

            The currency of Latvia is the Euro.

            Foreign currency is easily exchanged. While becoming increasingly uncommon, traveller\'s
            cheques can be cashed at banks for a fee.

            Credit cards (primarily Visa and MasterCard) are widely accepted in Riga and other major
            centres. Automated banking machines are widely available, and most will accept Canadian
            bank cards and major credit cards.

            When crossing one of the external border control points of the European Union, you must
            make a declaration to customs upon entry or exit if you have at least â‚¬10,000, or the
            equivalent in other currencies. The sum can be in cash, cheque, money order,
            traveller\'s cheque or any other convertible asset. This does not apply if you are
            travelling within the European Union or in transit to a non-EU country. For more

            Illegal or restricted activities

            It is prohibited to photograph or videotape government buildings or military personnel,
            equipment and installations. Taking photographs in areas with a Hezbollah presence has
            led to the detention and questioning of Canadians in the past. In such situations,
            Canadian officials may face delays and obstacles in providing assistance.

            Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are strict. Convicted
            offenders can expect jail sentences and heavy fines. Individuals charged with drug
            offences can expect to remain in jail and to be denied bail while judicial authorities
            prepare their case for prosecution. This process may take months or years.

            Homosexual activity is illegal.
            Dual citizenship

            Dual citizenship is not legally recognized, which may limit the ability of Canadian
            officials to provide you with consular services. You should travel using your Canadian
            passport and present yourself as Canadian to foreign authorities at all times. Canadians
            of Lebanese descent carrying Lebanese identification documents will be treated as
            Lebanese nationals by security officials.

            See Travelling as a dual citizen for more information.
            Child custody

            In cases where one or more family members hold Lebanese citizenship, parents should
            consider the risks before their children travel to Lebanon. At the request of family
            members, Lebanese authorities can prevent children from leaving Lebanon (a procedure
            known as a "stop order," which husbands can also apply to wives). Canadian children who
            are registered as Lebanese citizens will be treated as Lebanese nationals. Lebanon is
            not a signatory to the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child
            Abduction, and Canadian custody documents are not recognized in Lebanon.
            Dress and behaviour

            The dress code in Lebanon is more relaxed than in most countries in the Middle East.
            However, you should dress conservatively, behave discreetly and respect religious and
            social traditions to avoid offending local sensitivities.

            Sleeveless garments and shorts may be acceptable at most locations but should be avoided
            when visiting sites of religious significance, such as churches and mosques, and when
            travelling in conservative areas of the country.
            Money

            The currency is the Lebanese pound (LBP). Most establishments will accept payment in
            U.S. dollars but may return change in LBP. Credit cards are widely accepted in hotels,
            restaurants and shops. Traveller\'s cheques are not accepted and will not be changed by
            local financial institutions.

            Automated banking machines (ABMs) are widely available in Lebanon. Use ABMs located
            inside, or adjacent to, bank branches for greater security and to be able to retrieve a
            lost card faster.

            only at major tourist establishments and banks. Currency is readily available through
            automated banking machines (ABMs).

            The currency is the Liberian dollar (LRD). The economy is cash-based. U.S. dollars are
            widely accepted and easily converted into local currency. Traveller\'s cheques, credit
            and debit cards are not accepted anywhere in Liberia. Automated banking machines (ABMs)
            are unavailable. You are advised to carry sufficient funds in U.S. dollars to cover

            citizen for more information.
            Child custody

            Child custody decisions are based on Islamic law. It is extremely difficult for a
            Canadian woman, even if she is a Muslim, to obtain custody of her children through a
            court decision, unless she decides to stay in Libya. Regardless of parental marital
            status, children of Libyan fathers acquire Libyan citizenship at birth, and must enter
            and leave Libya on Libyan passports. Canadian mothers require their husband\'s
            permission to take their Libyan children outside the country.
            Culture

            Islamic practices and beliefs are closely adhered to in the country\'s customs, laws and
            regulations. Dress conservatively, behave discreetly, and respect religious and social
            traditions to avoid offending local sensitivities.

            Officials may confiscate your passport if you are involved in a business dispute.
            Money

            The economy is primarily cash-based. The currency, the Libyan dinar (LYD), is

            francs and Tunisian dinars can be converted into Libyan dinars. U.S. dollars can be
            exchanged at official exchange counters or banks. Adhere to the rules regarding currency

            Although France recognizes dual citizenship, dual citizens are considered French
            citizens and are subject to French laws. See Travelling as a dual citizen for more
            information.
            Dress and behaviour

            The majority of the population is Muslim. Dress conservatively, behave discreetly, and
            respect religious and social traditions to avoid offending local sensitivities.
            Money

            The currency is the Euro (EUR). Automated Banking machines are increasing in numbers and
            are common in Mamoudzou and Petite-Terre.

        <item>Illegal activities

            Penalties for breaking the law in Mexico can be more severe than in Canada, even for
            similar offences.

            Penalties for drug offences are very strict, and convicted offenders can expect lengthy
            jail sentences.

            You should avoid any involvement with illegal substances or those who deal with them.
            You should also avoid borrowing a vehicle or picking up hitchhikers; drivers are legally
            responsible for their vehicle\'s contents, as well as for the legal status of passengers
            and the items carried by passengers.

            The Mexican government strictly enforces its laws concerning possession, entry, and
            trafficking of firearms. Anyone (including foreign armed forces personnel) entering
            Mexico with a firearm or ammunition without prior written authorization from Mexican
            authorities is subject to imprisonment. It is also illegal to enter the country with
            certain types of knives. You can obtain a complete list of forbidden items and import
            permit requirements from the Embassy of Mexico in Canada.

            It is illegal to drink alcoholic beverages in non-designated public areas. The minimum
            age at which people are legally allowed to purchase or consume alcoholic beverages is 18
            years old.

            Participation in political activities (such as demonstrations) by foreigners is
            prohibited and should be avoided, as it may result in detention, deportation, or the
            denial of future entry into Mexico.

            It is illegal to possess archaeological artefacts or to export such items from Mexico.
            Dual citizenship

            Dual citizenship status may limit the ability of Canadian officials to provide consular
            services. See Dual citizenship for more information.
            Customs

            Tourists are allowed to bring in their personal effects duty-free. Failure to declare
            personal effects will result in their confiscation and a fine. Mexican customs provides
            information regarding entry into Mexico by air or land. When carrying more than
            US$10,000 or its equivalent in other currencies, cash, cheques, money orders, or any
            other monetary instrument, you must declare the amount exceeding US$10,000. Failure to
            make this declaration is against Mexican law and often results in detention.

            If you wish to donate goods, contact the Embassy of Mexico in Canada before sending or
            importing goods to Mexico in order to fulfill the importation permit requirements.
            Identity documents

            Mexican authorities require that the names indicated on your identity documents
            (generally your passport) be identical to those appearing on your birth certificate
            before issuing official documents, such as marriage certificates, immigration documents
            or Mexican passports. Many Canadians have encountered significant difficulties due to
            this requirement, as middle names are often left off Canadian identity documents. If you
            plan on residing in Mexico or dealing with Mexican Civil Registry, you should obtain a
            Canadian passport that will meet Mexican requirements.
            Vehicles and Boats

            Canadian driver\'s licences are valid in Mexico. The police sometimes ask foreigners to
            show identification and proof of their legal status in Mexico. You should always carry
            valid photo identification, your passport, visa, and other documents. Leave a certified
            copy of your vehicle registration with relatives or friends in Canada.

            a) Rentals

            The contract for a rental vehicle must be in the traveller\'s name and include a full
            description of the vehicle.

            b) Company-owned vehicles

            You must produce proof of employment and of the vehicle\'s ownership by the company.

            c) Importation

            Mexico has very strict rules regarding the entry of foreign vehicles and boats. Do not
            enter Mexico without having obtained the proper importation permit and car/boat
            insurance. Without a permit, you may be fined and have your vehicle seized. Contact the
            Embassy or a consulate of Mexico in Canada to verify the latest regulations and
            requirements regarding vehicle and boat importation. Complete information is available
            from Aduana MÃ©xico.

            Motor vehicles

            If you wish to travel beyond the border zone (20 to 30 kilometres from the U.S. border)
            with your car, you must obtain a Temporary Vehicle Importation Permit (Solicitud de
            importaciÃ³n temporal de vehÃ­culos). The permit can only be obtained at the port of
            entry or online at Aduana MÃ©xico before crossing the border into Mexico.

            You are only allowed to bring one vehicle into the country at a time. Those travelling
            with a recreational vehicle are not entitled to tow a second vehicle unless it is
            registered in the name of an accompanying traveller. The second vehicle should not
            exceed the weight limit of 3.5 tons. It is the owner\'s responsibility to obtain the
            permit through the Banco Nacional del EjÃ©rcito, Fuerza AÃ©rea y Armada or Aduana
            MÃ©xico 10 to 180 days before departure. Permits can also be obtained at one of the
            Mexican consulates located in Austin, Dallas, Houston, Los Angeles, Sacramento, San
            Bernardino, Albuquerque, Denver, and Phoenix, or at a customs office located along the
            U.S.-Mexico border or, in some cases, within an authorized border zone. Watch for signs
            indicating customs checkpoints and Banjercito Bank locations (where permits can be
            issued and cancelled).

            If you stay beyond the date indicated on the Temporary Vehicle Importation Permit, your
            vehicle may be seized.

            When leaving Mexico, you must return your Temporary Vehicle Importation Permit in
            person, along with the vehicle with which you entered the country, to any customs office
            at the border so that the permit can be cancelled. Keep a copy of the cancellation
            documents. Neither the Embassy of Canada in Mexico City nor the Embassy of Mexico in
            Ottawa can return these permits on behalf of Canadian citizens. It is not permissible to
            mail your permit to the border point. As long as the permit remains in effect, you will
            be unable to import another vehicle into Mexico. You may be able to cancel the permit on
            a future visit to Mexico if you enter at the same border point with the same vehicle;
            however, a fine may be imposed.

            In cases where the permit holder cannot exit the country with the vehicle (for example,
            in case of death or sickness), the person driving the car out of Mexico must be a
            foreigner with a valid tourist card and have documentation to prove the relationship
            with the car owner, such as a marriage or birth certificate.

            Boats

            It is the owner\'s responsibility to obtain the importation permit through the Banco
            Nacional del EjÃ©rcito, Fuerza AÃ©rea y Armada or Aduana MÃ©xico 7 to 60 days before
            departure. Permits can also be obtained at one of the Mexican consulates located in
            Austin, Dallas, Houston, Los Angeles, Sacramento, San Bernardino, Albuquerque, Denver,
            and Phoenix.

            Further information and online application forms can be found at Banco Nacional del
            EjÃ©rcito, Fuerza AÃ©rea y Armada (available in English and French).

            d) Purchasing/selling

            Foreigners who wish to purchase a car in Mexico must hold either temporary or permanent
            residency in Mexico, be able to pay vehicle taxes, and obtain Mexican licence plates. If
            you are interested in buying a car, consult local authorities.

            It is illegal to sell your imported vehicle in Mexico. If you do, your vehicle may be
            seized and you may be subject to a fine and deportation.
            Insurance

            Canadian automobile insurance is not recognized in Mexico. You must obtain additional
            insurance at the Mexican border. Full coverage is recommended, including coverage for
            legal assistance. Automobile insurance is much more expensive in Mexico than in Canada.
            Many local drivers do not have any form of car insurance.

            For more information on Mexican driver\'s permits, vehicle inspection, road tax, or
            mandatory insurance, please contact the SECTUR at 1-866-640-0597 (toll free from
            Canada).
            Accidents and fines

            In case of an accident or theft of your vehicle, you should immediately obtain a police
            report from the nearest police station (Ministerio PÃºblico) and present it to the
            Mexico City customs office (Aduanas) in order to cancel the Temporary Vehicle
            Importation Permit no later than five days after the incident. If you are involved in a
            traffic accident, you may face serious legal problems, including imprisonment. You could
            be taken into custody until responsibility for the accident is determined and all
            penalties are paid. If you do not have Mexican liability insurance, you could be
            prevented from leaving the country until all parties agree that adequate financial
            satisfaction has been received. Depending on the extent of injuries or damages, drivers
            may face criminal charges. Motor vehicle insurance is considered invalid in Mexico if
            the driver is found to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs at the time of the
            accident, or if the driver has no valid driver\'s licence.

            If you receive a fine for a driving infraction in certain parts of the country, the
            issuing police officer is obligated by law to retain your driver\'s license or
            registration until the fine is paid. Expect delays in recovering the document.
            Driving restrictions

            In order to reduce air pollution, time and day restrictions are imposed on driving in
            Mexico City as well as other regions of the country. Based on licence plate numbers,
            there is at least one day each week and one Saturday per month when driving is
            forbidden. This applies equally to permanent, temporary, and foreign plates. These
            regulations are strictly enforced. Offenders face heavy fines and temporary confiscation
            of their vehicle.

            A supplementary driving restriction has been implemented in Mexico City. Vehicles
            without plates from the State of Mexico (Estado de MÃ©xico) or the Federal District (DF)
            are not allowed to circulate from Monday to Friday from 5 a.m. to 11 a.m. For more
            information, consult the Mexican Ministry of the Environment (in Spanish). An exemption
            to this driving restriction may be obtained for cars with foreign plates by requesting a
            permit, the Pase TurÃ­stico (tourist pass), which is granted either for two periods of
            seven days or one period of 14 days in a six-month period. In order to obtain the
            tourist pass, you must register at Pase TurÃ­stico (in Spanish).
            Real estate

            You may acquire real estate in Mexico. However, you should consult a lawyer, as real
            estate transactions, laws, and practices can be complex and differ considerably from
            those in Canada. Choose your own lawyer or notary and avoid hiring the one recommended
            by the seller. Mexican real estate agents are not licensed or regulated.

            Research potential property purchases carefully, as irregularities occur, most
            frequently title challenges, which may result in litigation and possible eviction.
            Trusts do not guarantee that the purchase is legitimate. Visit the local Property
            Registry (Registro de Propiedad) and ask to see the property registry to confirm the
            name of the last owner and the fact that the property is free of any mortgage.
            Time-share agreements

            Reports of problems with time-share arrangements (including cancellation of contracts
            and fraudulent sales) have increased. Be prepared for the possibility of being
            approached by persistent time-share representatives on the street, as well as at the
            airport or on the way to your hotel. Be prepared for common pressure tactics, such as
            being told that promotions are only valid for that day and being offered free tours,
            meals, gifts, or alcoholic beverages.

            Before purchasing a time-share, gather as much information as possible, research the
            properties, and even get a legal opinion. If you do decide to buy, be sure to carefully
            review the contract. Anything not included in the contract will not be honoured. Only
            provide your credit card if you are certain you wish to make the purchase.

            Cancellation of contracts: Time-share companies have requested that their clients sign a
            waiver that prevents them from cancelling the contract. Such practices are illegal.
            Mexican law stipulates that consumers are legally entitled to cancel a time-share
            contract without penalty; however, the cancellation must be done within five working
            days starting from the day following the original date of purchase. Cancellations of
            contracts must be done in writing and must be presented directly to the time-share
            company. Keep copies of all correspondence.

            Fraudulent sale of time-shares: Companies and individuals may approach you claiming to
            have a buyer for your time-share and asking you to pay taxes beforehand. After payment
            of the so-called "taxes", Canadians have discovered that their time-share was never
            sold. If you experience any difficulties with a time-share company, you should
            immediately contact the Mexican Consumer Protection Agency, the ProcuradurÃ­a Federal
            del Consumidor (PROFECO).
            Renting

            Rental agreements between two individuals in Mexico are considered a private matter and
            are not regulated by the government. Should you encounter difficulties with a rental
            agreement and wish to take legal action, you will be required to obtain the services of
            a Mexican lawyer.
            Money

            The currency is the Mexican peso (MXN/MXV). Automated banking machine services are
            available throughout the country. Canadian debit and credit cards are widely accepted;
            however, Canadian currency and traveller\'s cheques are not. Some Canadians have
            recently reported that they were unable to withdraw cash from automated banking machines
            using Canadian debit cards. Consult with your bank before you travel.

            There is a limit to the amount of U.S. dollars that both residents and foreigners can
            exchange in Mexico, depending on your immigration status in Mexico. Although the rule
            does not apply to Canadian dollars, some financial institutions, hotels, and currency
            exchange bureaus are not making the distinction.

            31). Winter tires are mandatory during winter months. You must carry a fire
            extinguisher, a first aid kit and a warning triangle in your car. The use of a cellular
            telephone while driving is prohibited, unless it is fitted with a hands-free device.
            Import/export

            Strict regulations are in place regarding the export of antiques, artwork and items of
            historical Moldovan significance. You must seek the approval from the Moldovan
            Department of Monuments for the export of such material. Proof of the approval may be
            requested at the point of departure. Heavy fines or charges may be imposed if you fail
            to provide proof of approval to export.
            Money

            The currency is the Moldovan lei (MDL).

            An International Driving Permit is recommended. Always carry identification and vehicle
            registration papers.

            Drivers of vehicles bearing foreign licence plates must pay insurance. Road tolls must
            be paid in local currency. Montenegrin Government introduced an eco-tax for using road
            vehicles. Foreign nationals must pay the tax when entering Montenegro by car. The fee is
            determined according to the make and size of the vehicle. The eco-sticker obtained upon
            payment of the tax is valid for one year and must be displayed on the inside of the
            front windscreen in the upper right hand corner.

            Posted speed limits are strictly enforced. There have been incidents where police target
            vehicles with foreign plates, often demanding immediate cash payment for alleged traffic
            violations. If you are stopped, request a full explanation and, if an explanation is not
            forthcoming, ask permission to speak to the Embassy of Canada in Belgrade.

            discretion.


            Money

            The currency of Montenegro is the euro (EUR).

            The economy is largely cash-based. Banking facilities are limited, but automated banking
            machines (ABMs) are spreading rapidly throughout the country and provide the easiest
            access to local currency. More and more hotels, restaurants and shops accept credit
            cards.

            When crossing one of the external border control points of the European Union (EU), you
            must make a declaration to customs upon entry or exit if you have at least â‚¬10,000 or
            the equivalent in other currencies. For Montenegro, this amount is restricted to
            â‚¬2,000. The sum can be in cash, cheques, money orders, traveller\'s cheques or any
            other convertible assets. This does not apply if you are travelling within the EU or in
            transit to a non-EU country. For more information on the EU legislation and links to EU
            countries\' sites, visit the web page of the European Commission on cash controls.

            access to legal counsel or consular officials. If access is granted, it may be severely
            limited by the Omani authorities. Authorities may withhold the passport of an individual
            involved in a legal process, pending resolution of the case. This could result in the
            delay of a planned departure.
            Dress and behaviour

            The country\'s customs, laws and regulations adhere closely to Islamic practices and
            beliefs. Dress conservatively, behave discreetly and respect religious and social
            traditions to avoid offending local sensitivities.

            Exercise particular care in your behaviour with others, especially officials, to avoid
            offending local sensitivities. Verbal insults and obscene gestures may be considered a
            criminal act and, if found guilty, you could face deportation, fines and/or a prison
            sentence.
            Money

            The currency is the Omani rial (OMR). Credit cards and U.S. dollar traveller\'s cheques
            are widely accepted.

            Illegal or restricted activities

            Religious proselytizing is not permitted.

            The possession and consumption of alcohol is prohibited. Transgressions could be
            punished by detention or other penalties. Penalties for illegal drug possession, use, or

            Ask permission before taking photographs of local residents.
            Dual citizenship

            Dual citizenship is not legally recognized, which may limit the ability of Canadian
            officials to provide consular services. You should travel using your Canadian passport
            and present yourself as Canadian to foreign authorities at all times.

            If you were born in Pakistan, or if your father was born in Pakistan, you should confirm
            your citizenship status with the High Commission of Pakistan in Ottawa as you could be
            considered a Pakistani citizen while on Pakistani soil.

            See Travelling as a dual citizen for more information.
            Dress and behaviour

            The country\'s customs, laws and regulations adhere closely to Islamic practices and
            beliefs. Sharia law has been adopted in the Swat Valley. Dress conservatively, behave
            discreetly, and respect religious and social traditions to avoid offending local
            sensitivities.

            Shorts are considered inappropriate attire for both men and women, particularly in
            remote locations. Women should consider carrying a headscarf with them at all times
            while travelling in Pakistan. Consult our publication entitled Her Own Way: A Woman\'s
            Safe-Travel Guide for travel safety information specifically aimed at Canadian women.
            Money

            The currency is the Pakistani rupee (PKR). The economy mainly operates on a cash-only
            basis. Credit cards and traveller\'s cheques are accepted by a few establishments in
            larger cities. Currency can be exchanged at all international airports. Automated
            banking machines are available.

        <item>Illegal drugs

            Penalties for use, possession or trafficking of illegal drugs in Panama are very strict.
            Offenders can expect heavy fines and/or long jail sentences in difficult prison
            conditions.
            Laws

            Panamanian law requires all individuals to carry official identification documents at
            all times. Failure to produce identification upon request may result in travellers being
            taken to jail and charged a fine.

            Under the Panamanian penal code, knowingly infecting others with a sexually transmitted
            disease is a crime.

            Although homosexual activity is not illegal, discretion is highly recommended in public
            places since homosexuality is not socially acceptable in all areas.

            There may be curfews for minors (under 18 years old) in Panama City. Minors circulating
            alone late at night in Panama City may be detained by police until their parents can be
            contacted if the police deem that they are involved in suspicious activities. Fines may
            be imposed.

            Ask permission before taking photographs of individuals, particularly of children and
            women. When taking pictures of indigenous persons, it is normal to be asked to pay a
            small fee.

            You can use their provincial driver\'s licence in Panama for a period of up to 90 days,
            even though you are permitted to stay in Panama for up to 180 days without a visa.

            Although vehicle insurance is compulsory, many Panamanians drive without it. In the
            event of an accident, call 104 to reach the police, and do not move the vehicle until
            you are advised to do so by a police officer.

            Panama\'s legal system is complex. Reporting a crime differs greatly from reporting a
            crime in Canada and may vary from province to province. Local authorities generally do
            not speak English or French; therefore, a translator and/or legal representation may be
            required.
            Real estate

            You should consult with a reputable real estate agent and/or a local real estate lawyer
            before purchasing property in Panama.
            Money

            The official currency in Panama is the Balboa (PAB), which is used interchangeably with
            the U.S. dollar (USD). Because of problems with counterfeit US$50 and US$100 bills,
            carry small denominations of U.S. dollars.

            widely accepted. U.S. dollars can be exchanged in every exchange agency (casa de cambio)
            and at most banks. Credit cards are accepted in most hotels, restaurants, and shops.
        </item>
        <item>Illegal drugs

            Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are strict. Convicted
            offenders can expect lengthy jail sentences, regardless of the amount of narcotics
            seized at arrest.

            Pack your luggage yourself and keep it with you at all times. Do not carry anything
            through customs for anybody else.

            Prison conditions in Peru are poor.
            Laws

            Foreigners are required to carry photo identification at all times. Be cautious when you
            carry your passport, especially in entertainment venues. A photocopy of your
            passport--specifically the information, visa and entry stamp pages--is generally
            acceptable. However, police may require that you produce the original. Failure to show
            identification could result in detention and police questioning at the nearest station
            where fingerprints would be taken.

            You should respect local customs and laws when visiting Peru\'s historical sites. Fines
            and other penalties may be imposed by Peruvian authorities for any actions considered to
            be disrespectful at historical and archaeological sites such as Machu Picchu,
            Saqsayhuaman, and Ollantaytambo.

            Peruvian law strictly prohibits the export of antiques and artefacts (huacos) from
            pre-colonial civilizations. Travellers who purchase reproductions of colonial or
            pre-colonial art should buy only from reputable dealers and should insist upon
            documentation from Peru\'s National Institute of Culture showing that the object is a
            reproduction and may be exported.

            The export of coca tea bags is prohibited and it is illegal to remove certain fauna and
            flora items from Peru.

            It is forbidden to photograph military installations.

            A foreign driver\'s license can be used only in Lima for 30 days after arrival. To drive
            outside of Lima or for an extended period, an international driving permit is mandatory.
            Money

            The currency is the Peruvian nuevo sol (PEN). The US dollar is widely accepted. Credit
            cards are widely accepted in Lima, but less so outside major cities. Travellers cheques
            are not widely accepted. In small towns, automated banking machines (ABMs) may not be
            readily available. ABMs in large cities may accept out-of-country bank cards and credit
            cards. You should inform your banking company of your travel prior to departing and
            confirm whether you will be able to use ABMs in Peru.

            Counterfeit currency in both nuevo sol and U.S. dollars is a growing and serious
            problem. Counterfeit bills are widely distributed, including by banks, casinos and local
            stores. Tourists should be aware of the security features of the currency they are using
            and be aware of scams involving switching legitimate bills with counterfeit.

        <item>Laws

            Attending any protest, demonstration or political rally may lead to detention and
            deportation.

            Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are strict. Convicted
            offenders can face life imprisonment for certain drug-related crimes.

            A lifetime sentence is also often imposed for rape.

            Conviction for "swindling" or "bad debts" can result in sentences of up to 20 years.

            Penalties for pedophile activity are strict. Under Philippine law, a child is defined as
            a person under the age of 18. An adult may be reported to the police if he or she is a)
            seen with an unrelated child of 12 years or younger, or who is 10 years or more his
            junior, or b) seen alone with an unrelated child inside the room of a house, hotel or
            other similar establishment, vehicle or other secluded location, and is believed to have
            the intention to sexually exploit said child.

            The import or export of more than 10,000 Philippine pesos (bills and coins only) must be
            authorized by the Central Bank of the Philippines.

            Photography of official buildings intended for publication is prohibited.

            Foreigners are required to carry identification. A photocopy of the identification page
            of your passport is acceptable.

            An International Driving Permit is recommended. However, you should apply for a local
            driving permit if you wish to drive in the Philippines for more than 90 days from the
            date of your arrival in the country.

            You may bring your own medicines, but only in quantities sufficient for the duration of
            your stay. Bring a letter from your physician if you are carrying prescription drugs,
            stating the dosage and the condition for which you are receiving treatment. If you are
            travelling onward to another country, a separate quantity of prescription drugs should
            be sealed and declared again before departing the Philippines.

            If you plan to get married in the Philippines, ensure that you are well informed
            regarding Philippine requirements. Consult the Embassy of Canada to the Philippines for
            more information.
            Money

            The currency is the Philippine peso (PHP). Credit cards are accepted in major
            establishments. U.S. dollar traveller\'s cheques can sometimes be exchanged in certain
            banks and hotels; verify with the issuing authority in Canada before purchasing them for
            use in the Philippines. Automated banking machines are available in larger cities.

            Language

            The official and commonly spoken language in Poland is Polish. Services in English can
            generally be found at hotels, restaurants and shops in major tourist locations. French
            is not commonly spoken in Poland. You may experience difficulties in obtaining services
            in English or French outside major tourist destinations. This is also true of many
            governmental services, including medical care, police services and public
            transportation.
            Driving laws

            An International Driving Permit is required.

            Credit cards and debit cards are accepted. Automated banking machines (ABMs) are
            available in all major cities and towns. Traveller\'s cheques are less common and often
            not accepted.

            When crossing one of the external border control points of the European Union (EU), you
            must make a declaration to Customs upon entry or exit if you have at least â‚¬10,000, or
            the equivalent in other currencies. The sum can be in cash, cheques, money orders,
            traveller\'s cheques or any other convertible assets. This does not apply if you are

            Illegal or restricted activities

            Religious proselytizing is not permitted.

            Avoid public displays of affection, including holding hands and kissing.

            Drunk driving, public intoxication and other alcohol-related offenses, possession and/or
            use or trafficking in illegal drugs are illegal in Qatar.

            Common-law relationships, adultery, prostitution and possession of pornographic material
            are illegal and are subject to severe punishment.

            The laws of Qatar prohibit sexual acts between individuals of the same sex. Other
            related offences include being in a same-sex marriage and promoting homosexuality.
            Convicted offenders can face up to life imprisonment or the death penalty. LGBT
            travellers should carefully consider the risks of travelling to Qatar. See Gay, lesbian,
            bisexual and transgender travel for more information.

            Do not drink alcohol outside licensed hotels.

            It is forbidden to photograph government buildings and military installations. Do not
            photograph people without their permission.
            Customs

            Do not import pork products, alcohol or pornographic material. Videos are subject to
            scrutiny and may be censored.
            Dual citizenship

            Dual citizenship is not legally recognized, which may limit the ability of Canadian
            officials to provide consular services. You should travel using your Canadian passport
            and present yourself as Canadian to foreign authorities at all times. See Travelling as
            a dual citizen for more information.
            Marriage

            If you marry a Qatari citizen, the Qatari government may inform you that you have lost
            your Canadian citizenship. Note, however, that governments do not have the authority to
            annul citizenships of other countries. If such an event occurs, contact the nearest
            Canadian government office as soon as possible. For more information, consult Marriage
            Overseas.
            Custody

            Children of a Qatari father automatically acquire Qatari citizenship at birth and must
            enter and leave the country on a Qatari passport. Child custody decisions are based on
            Islamic law. It is difficult for a Western woman, even a Muslim, to obtain custody of
            her children through the Qatari courts. Minor children of a Qatari-national father must
            have his permission to leave the country.
            Legal process

            Suspects and witnesses to incidents may be held for a few days without access to legal
            counsel or consular officials. If access is granted, it may be severely limited by the
            Qatari authorities. The Embassy of Canada to the State of Qatar is usually not notified
            by the authorities when a Canadian citizen is arrested. Authorities may withhold the
            passport of an individual involved in legal processes, including labour dispute, or
            issue a travel ban, pending resolution of the case. These processes can last up to
            several years.
            Dress and behaviour

            The country\'s customs, laws and regulations adhere closely to Islamic practices and
            beliefs. Exercise common sense and discretion in dress and behaviour, and dress
            conservatively. Western women do not usually cover their head. Western women may wear
            dresses and skirts, provided they cover the shoulders and knees; shorts, short skirts
            and tight and revealing clothing are considered inappropriate.

            Exercise particular care in your behaviour with others, especially officials, to avoid

            Illegal activities

            There are harsh penalties for engaging in sexual acts with a minor (the age of consent
            in Romania is 18). In addition, Canadians may be prosecuted at home for sexually
            exploiting children while abroad. Consult our publication Child Sex Tourism: It\'s a

            Road travel

            A Canadian driver\'s licence is valid in Romania for stays up to 90 days; a local
            driver\'s licence is required for longer stays. Residents must have a Romanian driver\'s
            licence. You must carry vehicle registration and proof of insurance.

            Headlights must be on at all times when driving, regardless of the time of day or

            The economy is primarily cash-based. You may exchange Euros in recognized
            establishments, such as exchange shops, banks and hotels. Carry crisp bills, as
            well-worn or used banknotes may not be accepted. Traveller\'s cheques are not widely
            accepted.

            Credit cards are widely accepted in major urban centres. Most retailers use personal
            identification number technology for credit cards. Automated banking machines are widely
            available in major cities and, increasingly, in smaller towns.

            When crossing one of the external border control points of the European Union (EU), you
            must make a declaration to customs upon entry or exit if you are carrying at least
            â‚¬10,000 or the equivalent in other currencies. The sum can be in cash, cheques, money

            Although homosexual activity is not illegal in Russia, a federal law has been passed
            that prohibits public actions that are described as promoting homosexuality and
            "non-traditional sexual relations". This law could render any homosexual and
            pro-homosexual statements punishable. Public actions (including dissemination of
            information, statements, displays or conspicuous behaviour) that contravene or appear to
            contravene this law may lead to arrest, the imposition of a fine and deportation.

            Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender travellers, as well as their friends and
            families, have been targets of harassment and violence.

            Taking photos of railways, bridges, dams, airports, train stations, the underground
            Metro system and all official buildings is prohibited. Incidents have occurred at
            marketplaces where Canadians have taken photos of market stalls and found themselves
            remanded to market police. Cameras, film and other equipment may be confiscated, and
            fines payable in cash on the spot may be imposed. Ask permission before taking
            photographs.
            Identification documents

            You may be fined or detained for failing to provide proper documentation to Russian
            authorities. Carry your original passport (photocopies are not acceptable), entry/exit
            visa and registered migration card at all times. Failure to provide identification
            documents could result in heavy fines or a jail sentence.
            Traffic police

            The traffic police can only stop motorists and impose fines for traffic violations.
            Although they can also conduct identity checks on pedestrians, they have no authority to
            impose fines. The same is true of police in the underground Metro systems. Only the
            special police of the Federal Migration Bureau have the authority to arrest, detain, and
            impose fines on improperly documented foreigners. If you are stopped in the street and
            requested to pay a fine, ask to see the officer\'s name and identification and to
            contact the Embassy of Canada in Moscow.
            Dual citizenship

            Although dual citizenship is not legally recognized in Russia, beginning August 3, 2014,
            Russian citizens residing in Russia who also possess a foreign citizenship or permanent
            residency status in another country must declare this citizenship or residency status to
            their local migration office. See the Federal Migration Service of the Russian
            Federation (in Russian only) for more details on this requirement and consequences of
            non-compliance.

            See Travelling as a dual citizen for more information.
            Importation / exportation

            Russia has very strict rules on the importation of medication: certain prescription and
            over-the-counter drugs that are common in Canada may be prohibited, and large quantities
            of any medicine will be scrutinized.

            The importation and use of electronic equipment are strictly controlled. Foreigners have
            faced charges of espionage for possessing improperly certified GPS (Global Positioning
            System) devices, such as those used for geological mapping.

            You must obtain a certificate from the Ministry of Culture to export items that appear
            old (prior to 1945) or that have cultural value. Customs officials may conduct thorough
            baggage searches and may arrest you if you do not have the necessary certificate.

            credit cards, travellers\' cheques and bank cards as methods of payment or to obtain
            cash. Traveller\'s cheques can be cashed only at a few locations in Moscow, such as
            American Express offices. Credit cards and traveller\'s cheques are not widely accepted
            outside Moscow and St. Petersburg. Automated banking machines (ABMs) are common in main

            Canadian women married to Saudi men and Canadians under 21 years of age with a Saudi
            father need the permission of the Saudi male head of the household to leave the country.
            Married women, no matter their husband\'s citizenship, require their husband\'s
            permission to leave the country, while all unmarried women, regardless of age, and
            unmarried men under the age of 21 require the permission of their father or male
            guardian to leave the country, irrespective of the father\'s or guardian\'s nationality.

            A Saudi man who wishes to marry a foreign woman is required by law to seek the
            permission of Saudi authorities. He must also sign a document that gives irrevocable
            permission to his foreign wife and the children born of their union to travel in and out
            of the country without restrictions. This law has been in effect since February 20,
            2008, and is not retroactive. Regardless of this law, the foreign spouse and their
            children may still have difficulty leaving Saudi Arabia whenever they wish.
            Legal process

            The Saudi judicial system is based on Sharia law. The legal process may be slow and
            cumbersome. Those suspected of and witnesses to offences may be held for lengthy periods
            without access to legal counsel or consular officials. If access is granted, it may be
            severely limited by Saudi authorities.
            Business

            Arabic is the only officially recognized language for business transactions.

            Examine all conditions carefully and ensure that you fully understand them prior to
            accepting a job offer or signing a contract. Include oral understandings in the
            contract.

            Obtain the services of an independent Saudi-based lawyer and ensure translation of all
            documents, especially the contract, in order to be fully aware of all conditions, limits
            and terms.

            Seek legal advice from a Canadian or Saudi lawyer before signing any contract. If in
            doubt, seek advice from a lawyer in Canada. A list of local lawyers is available from
            the Embassy of Canada in Riyadh.

            In case of a dispute, a Saudi complainant may prevent a foreigner from leaving the
            country until the dispute is settled.
            Money

            The currency is the Saudi riyal (SAR). Credit cards and traveller\'s cheques are widely
            accepted, especially in main cities.

        <item>Laws and illegal activities

            Driving under the influence of alcohol is illegal. Convicted offenders are subject to a
            jail sentence, a fine or both.

            Possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs may result in long jail sentences, heavy
            fines or both.

            It is prohibited to photograph government buildings, airports or other official
            facilities.

            Homosexual activity is a criminal offence and could result in a prison sentence of one

            Dress and behaviour

            Exercise common sense and discretion in dress and behaviour. Respect religious and
            social traditions to avoid offending local sensitivities.
            Border crossings

            Bribe requests from border officials have sparked violent incidents at Diama, one of the
            official land border crossings into Mauritania. Do not cross the Senegal River by
            private pirogue; to do so is illegal and dangerous.
            Customs formalities

            Some items, including auto parts, computers and computer parts, stereo equipment, tape
            players, tools, and video cameras and players, are subject to strict customs regulations
            and cannot be brought into the country without clearance by Senegalese authorities.
            Contact the Embassy of the Republic of Senegal for further information on customs
            requirements.
            Money

            The currency is the African Financial Community CFA franc (or XOF bank code).

            Avoid exchanging large quantities of CFA francs for foreign currency from other than
            reputable exchange bureaus.

            Automated banking machines are widespread and reliable in Dakar, although withdrawal
            limits may be quite low.

            Credit cards are rarely accepted except by major hotels, travel agencies and airline
            companies. Credit card cash advances can be obtained, but are time-consuming to
            complete.
        </item>
        <item>Canada and Serbia are signatories to the European Convention on the Transfer of
            Sentenced Persons. This enables a Canadian imprisoned in Serbia to request a transfer to
            a Canadian prison to complete a sentence. The transfer requires the agreement of both
            Canadian and Serbian authorities.
            Identification

            Carry adequate identification at all times. Keep a photocopy of your passport in case of
            loss or seizure.
            Illegal activities

            Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are strict. Convicted
            offenders can expect long jail sentences and heavy fines.

            unless authorized by the Ministry of Defence.
            Dual citizenship

            Canadians who are also citizens of Serbia are no longer subject to compulsory military
            service. Those who have not regulated their draft status should check with a Serbian
            embassy or consulate prior to travelling to ensure that their status has been resolved.
            See Travelling as a dual citizen for more information.
            Homosexuality

            While Serbian law forbids discrimination based on sexual orientation, homosexuality is
            not widely accepted by Serbian society. Visitors are advised to exercise discretion.
            Driving laws

            An International Driving Permit is recommended. Always carry identification, vehicle
            registration and insurance papers.

            Road tolls can be paid in local currency, Euros, or by credit card. The posted speed
            limits are strictly enforced.
            Money

            The currency is the new Serbian dinar (RSD).

            The economy is largely cash-based. Automated banking machines (ABMs) are widely
            available and provide the easiest access to local currency. More and more hotels,
            restaurants and shops accept credit cards. If you are arriving with cash, you will need
            to exchange it for dinars. All banks and exchange offices will readily convert euros.
            Note that euros are not legal tender in Serbia.

            Traveller\'s cheques (American Express) can be exchanged at only a few banks in
            Belgrade.

            When crossing one of the external border control points of the European Union (EU), you
            must make a declaration to customs upon entry or exit if you have at least â‚¬10,000 or
            the equivalent in other currencies. The sum can be in cash, cheques, money orders,
            traveller\'s cheques or any other convertible assets. This does not apply if you are
            travelling within the EU or in transit to a non-EU country. For more information on the
            EU legislation and links to EU countries\' sites, visit the web page of the European
            Commission on cash controls.
            Customs

            When leaving Serbia, you will need to return a certified copy of Custom declaration so
            the money (up to the amount brought in but not exceeding â‚¬10,000 in value) can be
            taken out again. If you fail to comply with these rules, your money may be confiscated.
            In order to avoid customs charges, you are required to declare items of value (e.g.
            jewellery, photographic and computing equipment) that you are temporarily importing into
            Serbia. These items should be intended for your own personal use and you must take them
            with you when leaving the country.

            cards are not widely accepted and automated banking machines (ABMs) are unavailable. You
            should exchange foreign currency at banks or official foreign exchange offices only. The

            luggage may be inspected for regulated items.

            Common-law relationships are not recognized. Individuals in common-law relationships may
            be requested to provide a certificate of non-impediment to marriage by the local

            driver\'s licence or an IDP in order to honour an insurance claim, even when such proof
            was not requested at the time the policy was secured. An IDP must be obtained in Canada
            before travelling to South Africa, as it cannot be obtained locally.

            If your licence is in French, it is advisable to obtain a translation into English and
            carry it with you.
            Foreigners driving a rental car across any border into neighbouring countries must
            obtain a permit from the Cross-border Road Transport Agency prior to arriving at the
            border crossing. Failure to do so may lead to arrest and/or a fine.
            Money

            The currency is the South African rand (ZAR). Canadian currency and traveller\'s cheques
            can be easily exchanged at major banks and foreign exchange counters. A passport and
            additional identification is required when undertaking foreign exchange transactions.

            Foreigners are permitted to enter South Africa carrying a maximum of ZAR100,000, or
            US$10,000 or its equivalent in foreign currencies. Customs forms are not required to be
            completed, but random customs checks are conducted.

        <item>A permit for photography is required. Permits can be obtained at the Ministry of
            Information. Even with a photography permit, taking pictures of or near military
            installations is strictly prohibited, and it is highly unadvisable to take pictures in
            urban settings.

            Public displays of affection between members of the opposite sex are frowned upon

            Homosexual activity is illegal.
            Culture

            By Western standards, the Republic of South Sudan is a traditional, conservative
            society. Women should dress conservatively (no short skirts, bare arms or low
            necklines); men and women should not wear shorts in public and should be extremely
            discreet when swimming.
            Money

            The currency is the South Sudan pound (SSP). The Sudan pound is not recognized as legal
            tender. Only change money at banks and other established institutions, as money changers
            who operate on the street often scam travellers with counterfeit notes. You should carry
            sufficient funds in U.S. dollars to cover your expenses for the duration of your stay
            and assume that you will have to pay for all international flights booked in South Sudan
            in U.S. dollars. Transferring U.S. or Canadian dollars to the country is impossible.
            Currency exchange houses and merchants do not accept U.S. currency dated before 2006,
            and will reject notes with any marks.

            Credit cards and traveller\'s cheques are not accepted in South Sudan. There are
            automated banking machines (ABMs), but they are not reliable, and only dispense SSPs.
            Larger expenses, such as hotel bills, must be paid in cash.
        </item>
        <item>Canada and Spain are signatories to the European Convention on the Transfer of
            Sentenced Persons. This enables a Canadian imprisoned in Spain to request a transfer to

            Canadian and Spanish authorities.
            Illegal drugs

            Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are strict. Convicted
            offenders can expect jail sentences or heavy fines.
            Illegal activities

            In the cities of Madrid and Barcelona, and in the Balearic and Canary islands, the
            consumption of alcohol in the street, other than in authorized outdoor cafÃ©s and bars,
            has been banned by various municipal or regional authorities. You must respect this law;
            fines are imposed for failure to comply.

            a hands-free device.

            Vehicles must be equipped for emergency situations: two red warning triangles that you
            must place in front of and behind the vehicle in case of accident or breakdown; a
            reflective jacket that you must wear when leaving a vehicle that is stranded or involved
            in a highway accident; and a spare tire and full set of spare light bulbs, plus the
            tools to change them. Drivers who fail to comply with these laws may be subject to
            on-the-spot fines.

            Penalties for drinking and driving are strict. The legal blood alcohol limit is 0.05
            percent or 0.03 percent for new drivers. Convicted offenders can expect heavy fines or
            jail sentences, and driver\'s licences may be confiscated.

            the equivalent in other currencies. The sum can be in cash, cheques, money orders,
            traveller\'s cheques or any other convertible assets. This does not apply if you are
            travelling within the EU or in transit to a non-EU country. For more information on the
            EU legislation and links to EU countries\' sites, visit the web page of the European
            Commission on cash controls.
            Investments

            If you are interested in purchasing property or making other investments in Spain, seek
            legal advice from appropriate professionals in Canada and in Spain before making
            commitments. Disputes arising from such activities could be prolonged and costly to
            resolve.

            or deportation.

            Carry official identification at all times.

            An international driving permit is required.
            Culture

            Money

            The currency is the Sri Lankan rupee (LKR). Most major banks will change U.S. dollar
            traveller\'s cheques as well as permit Visa and MasterCard cash withdrawals. Credit
            cards are widely accepted in major urban and tourist centres. There are automated
            banking machines (ABMs) in major cities, but some do not accept international cards.

        <item>Laws and illegal activities

            Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are severe. Bags are
            routinely searched upon arrival and departure at the Khartoum airport.

            The laws of Sudan prohibit sexual acts between individuals of the same sex. Third time
            convicted offenders can face up to life imprisonment or the death penalty. LGBT
            travellers should carefully consider the risks of travelling to Sudan. See Homosexual,
            bisexual and transgender travel for more information.

            It is prohibited to import or consume alcohol (even in private) and to import magazines

            strictly prohibited to photograph airports, military areas, bridges, drainage stations,
            broadcast stations, public utilities, slum areas or beggars. Any photography without a
            permit immediately draws suspicion of espionage, and individuals, including foreigners,
            have been detained. If you travel with your laptop, ensure that you remove any photo
            files that could be deemed by the authorities as suspicious or controversial.

            It is illegal to use a mobile phone while driving.

            An International Driving Permit is recommended.

            and its export is prohibited. You should carry sufficient funds in U.S. dollars, euros
            or pounds sterling to cover your expenses for the duration of your stay. You may have to
            pay for international flights booked in Sudan in cash: U.S. dollars, euros or pounds
            sterling. Transferring U.S. or Canadian dollars to Sudan is difficult because of
            international sanctions. U.S. currency dated prior to 2006 is not usually accepted.

            Foreign banking and credit cards are not accepted in Sudan. There are automated banking
            machines (ABMs), but they only service local accounts. Traveller\'s cheques are also not

            upon. Due to international sanctions, several foreign credit institutions and banks have
            suspended their transactions with Syria. This includes MasterCard and Visa credit cards
            and bank cards operating under the Cirrus, Maestro and Plus transaction networks; note

            departure. The Syrian pound cannot be exchanged outside the country.

            In August 2011, the Syrian government established limitations on the withdrawal of
            foreign currency in Syria. Regulations regarding financial transactions and currency
            exchange can change without notice.

            stated in the contract before accepting an offer. Written contracts are usually binding
            documents. Verbal agreements may in certain circumstances take precedence over written
            agreements. English teachers should always ensure to obtain proper work permits prior

            Surrogacy

            The Thai Parliament passed a legislation banning commercial surrogacy on February 20,
            2015. While this legislation is awaiting royal approval, Thai authorities may prohibit
            commercial surrogacy and are taking immediate steps to ensure that children of such
            arrangements are not permitted to exit the country in anticipation of the legislation.

            If you are visiting Thailand for the purposes of commercial surrogacy arrangements, you
            should seek independent legal advice before entering into any agreement. In particular,
            legal advice should be sought on the implications of any new exit requirements. A list
            of local lawyers who speak English and/or French is available on the website of the
            Embassy of Canada in Bangkok.

            If you have already entered into such an arrangement, you should also seek advice from a
            local lawyer on how this legislation could affect your situation and, in particular, on
            any exit requirements. You may also wish to contact the consular section of the Embassy
            of Canada in Bangkok to inform them of your particular situation. This will enable them
            to contact you in the event of any developments or should consular assistance be
            required.

        <item>A serious violation may lead to a jail sentence. The sentence will be served in local
            prisons.
            Identification

            Carry adequate identification at all times. Keep a photocopy of your passport in case of
            loss or seizure.

            Local police may ask to see your passport and visa at any time. Always cooperate with
            local authorities. Be aware that you may be detained for up to three hours while your
            identification documents are being verified. Racially motivated mistreatment or
            harassment by Ukrainian authorities occurs.
            Illegal drugs

            Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are strict. Convicted
            offenders can expect jail sentences and heavy fines.
            Driving laws

            An International Driving Permit or a Ukrainian driver\'s licence is required, and car
            insurance is mandatory.

            There is zero tolerance for driving under the influence of alcohol. Police are permitted
            to fine you on the spot.
            Money

            The currency is the hryvnia (UAH).

            The economy operates primarily on a cash basis. However, credit cards are accepted in
            most major cities. Foreign currency can be exchanged at banks, hotels and licensed
            exchange booths. Carry crisp bills, as well-worn or used U.S. banknotes may not be
            accepted. Automated banking machines (ABMs) are available, but new bank cards with a
            microchip cannot be used.
            Customs

            There are strict customs regulations and procedures regarding the export of antiquities
            and items of historical interest.
        </item>
        <item>The work week is from Sunday to Thursday.

            An International Driving Permit is required.
            Laws

            Religious proselytizing is not permitted.

            Common-law relationships, homosexual relations, adultery and prostitution are illegal
            and are subject to severe punishment, including the death penalty.

            Avoid physical contact, such as holding hands, in public.

            Possession of pork is illegal in Sharjah.

            Possession of pornographic material is illegal in all emirates.

            Possession of prohibited items may result in imprisonment and deportation.

            It is forbidden to photograph certain government buildings and military installations.
            Do not photograph people without their permission.

            Procedures to follow in the event of a car accident vary depending on the emirate you
            are visiting. Although you must report all accidents to the police, you should
            familiarize yourself with the rules of the different emirates on whether you may move
            your car to the side of the road in the event of an accident or have to wait until the
            police arrive. Drivers involved in an accident resulting in injuries may be jailed until
            the injured persons are released from hospital. In an accident resulting in fatalities,
            compensation is regularly awarded to the family of the deceased. Lengthy court
            proceedings may result from relatively minor accidents.
            Consumption of prescription or illicit drugs

            Criminal penalties for the possession, use and trafficking of illegal drugs, as well as
            poppy seeds, are strict and include the death penalty. Convicted offenders can expect
            lengthy jail sentences and heavy fines. The possession of drugs, even a very small
            amount, can result in arrest and, if convicted, a four-year minimum prison sentence. The
            use of drugs deemed illegal by U.A.E. authorities, even if used while outside of the
            U.A.E., is a prosecutable offence if traces of the substance are found in the blood or
            urine, and can also carry a minimum prison sentence of four years.

            Canadians have been imprisoned in the U.A.E. for possession, use or trafficking of
            illegal drugs, including drugs used outside of the U.A.E. that were still traceable in
            their blood or urine. Prescription or over-the-counter drugs that are legal in Canada,
            such as codeine, may be restricted in the U.A.E. See Entry/Exit Requirements for more
            information.
            Alcohol consumption

            Respect restrictions concerning the consumption of alcohol. It is illegal for all
            Muslims to consume or possess alcohol. The consumption of alcohol outside approved
            venues is illegal and could result in arrest, fines and imprisonment. Public
            intoxication is a criminal offence, no matter where the alcohol was consumed. There is
            no acceptable legal blood alcohol content limit. You may be required to take blood and
            urine tests if you are suspected of being under the influence of drugs or alcohol. If
            the tests are positive, you may be prosecuted. In Sharjah, the possession and
            consumption of alcohol are illegal and subject to criminal prosecution. There is a zero
            tolerance policy regarding drinking and driving.
            Dress and behaviour

            The country\'s customs, laws and regulations adhere closely to Islamic practices and
            beliefs. Dress conservatively, behave discreetly and respect religious and social
            traditions to avoid offending local sensitivities.

            Women should not wear tight or revealing clothing or short skirts. Men and women should
            both refrain from wearing shorts. Transgressions can lead to detention and other
            penalties.

            Exercise particular care in your behaviour with others, especially officials, to avoid
            offending local sensitivities. Verbal insults and obscene gestures may be considered a
            criminal act and, if found guilty, the accused could face deportation, fines and a
            prison sentence. Canadians have been detained on allegations of showing disrespect
            toward others by making verbal insults and obscene gestures.
            Dual citizenship

            The U.A.E. do not recognize dual citizenship, which may limit the ability of Canadian
            officials to provide consular services. Travel using your Canadian passport and present
            yourself as Canadian to foreign authorities at all times. See Travelling as a dual
            citizen for more information.
            Child custody

            Child custody decisions are based on Islamic (Sharia) law. It is extremely difficult for
            a Canadian woman, even if she is a Muslim, to obtain custody of her children through a
            court decision. Regardless of parental marital status, children of U.A.E. fathers
            acquire U.A.E. citizenship at birth, and must enter and leave the emirates on U.A.E.
            passports. The father\'s permission is required to leave the country.
            Legal process

            Witnesses to incidents, as well as suspects, may be held for lengthy periods without
            access to legal counsel or consular officials. Authorities may withhold the passport of
            an individual involved in legal processes, pending resolution of the case. This could
            result in the delay of a planned departure.

            Familiarize yourself with the rules and laws of each emirate to which you intend to
            travel.

            Courts may impose a sentence of corporal punishment on Muslims convicted of certain
            crimes, even if the individual is not a citizen of the U.A.E. Although the sentence is
            typically commuted to prison time, do not rely on this tendency, as a sentence of
            corporal punishment can still be enforced under Sharia.
            Fraud

            Fraudulent practices, such as writing cheques without sufficient funds, and failing to
            pay your debts are regarded as extremely serious offences and may result in criminal
            prosecution, imprisonment and fines. Penalties are generally assessed according to
            Sharia law. Bail is not available for non-residents of the U.A.E. Temporary release
            pending legal action may be granted in minor cases if the passport of the accused and
            the passport of the guarantor are surrendered to the authorities.
            Employment

            Clearly establish the terms and conditions of employment in writing prior to your
            arrival in the U.A.E. It is customary for a local sponsor to retain an employee\'s
            passport, but this is not required under U.A.E. law. The U.A.E. Ministry of Labour has
            established a special department to review and arbitrate labour claims in cases of
            dispute. A list of local attorneys is available from the Embassy of Canada in Abu Dhabi
            or the Consulate of Canada in Dubai.
            Money

            The currency is the U.A.E. dirham (AED). Major credit cards and traveller\'s cheques are
            accepted in major hotels and restaurants; however, prices may be cheaper if you pay in
            cash. Automated banking machines are widely available.
        </item>
        <item>Canada and United Kingdom are signatories to the European Convention on the Transfer
            of Sentenced Persons. This enables a Canadian imprisoned in United Kingdom to request a
            transfer to a Canadian prison to complete a sentence. The transfer requires the
            agreement of both Canadian and British authorities.
            Driving laws

            Although an International Driving Permit is recommended, you can drive with a valid
            Canadian licence for up to 12 months from your date of entry.

            A fee is charged to those driving into central London. This "congestion charge" is
            indicated by a large "C" painted on the roads. You can pay the fee by phone, online or
            at selected shops and gas stations. Visit the Transport for London website for further
            details.

            Penalties for drinking and driving are strict. Convicted offenders can expect heavy
            fines or jail sentences.
            Imports

            You may import up to one kilogram of meat cooked in a can or hermetically sealed
            container. It is illegal to import firearms, tear gas canisters and certain types of
            knives. The HM Revenue and Customs website provides information on what items you can
            bring into the United Kingdom and what you have to declare.
            Money

            The currency of United Kingdom is the pound sterling (GBP).

            Credit cards are widely accepted and automated banking machines (ABMs) are widely
            available. Traveller\'s cheques are not usually accepted at retail outlets but can be
            exchanged at banks.

            When crossing one of the external border control points of the European Union (EU), you
            must make a declaration to customs upon entry or exit if you have at least â‚¬10,000 or
            the equivalent in other currencies. The sum can be in cash, cheques, money orders,
            traveller\'s cheques or any other convertible assets. This does not apply if you are
            travelling within the EU or in transit to a non-EU country. For more information on the
            EU legislation and links to EU countries\' sites, visit the web page of the European
            Commission on cash controls.
        </item>
        <item>Illegal and prescription drugs

            The U.S. zero tolerance policy imposes severe penalties for the possession of even a
            small amount of an illegal drug.

            Even prescription drugs and syringes used for legitimate medical purposes come under
            intense scrutiny. Carrying medicines in their original containers and carrying a
            duplicate of your original prescription, listing both the generic and trade names of the
            drug, is recommended. Never carry a package or luggage for someone else unless you have
            been able to verify the contents completely.

            Personal medication may be subject to U.S. drug importation laws and regulations. In
            general, personal importation of a 90-day supply of medication is allowed, but only if
            the drug is not available in the U.S. Prescription drugs imported through the mail from
            Canada are carefully scrutinized. For further information, please consult the U.S. Food
            and Drug Administration.
            Laws

            A serious violation of the law may lead to a jail sentence or, in some states, a death
            sentence. The jail sentence will be served in a local prison. Canada and the U.S. do,
            however, have a treaty that permits a Canadian imprisoned in the U.S. to request a
            transfer to Canada to complete the sentence in a Canadian prison. The transfer requires
            the agreement of both Canadian and American authorities. Canadian citizenship confers no
            immunity, special protection or rights to preferential treatment.
            Imports and exports

            A non-resident may bring merchandise worth up to US$200 free of duty for personal or
            household use into the U.S. On visits of 72 hours or more, you may carry an additional
            US$100 worth of merchandise free of duty as gifts for other people. Certain items are
            prohibited. More information is available from the U.S. CBP.

            For information on personal duty purchase exemptions at the border when returning to
            Canada, please consult the Canada Border Services Agency.
            Travel to Cuba

            Residents of the U.S., including Canadian citizens, are subject to U.S. law regarding
            travel to Cuba. They are prohibited from spending money (in any currency) relating to
            Cuban travel unless they are licensed by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC).
            Pets

            When examined at a port of entry, cats and dogs must show no signs of diseases
            communicable to humans. If there is evidence of poor animal health, an examination by a
            licensed veterinarian might be required, at the expense of the owner. The U.S.
            authorities may also require a health certificate. Vaccination against rabies is not
            required for cats. Dogs must be vaccinated against rabies at least 30 days before entry,
            except for puppies under three months of age. Other animals are also subject to controls
            or quarantine requirements. Additional information is available from the U.S. CBP and
            local authorities.

            When you return to Canada, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency will require proof of
            vaccination against rabies for all cats and dogs over three months of age. For detailed
            information, contact the Canadian Food Inspection Agency.
            Automobile insurance

            If you are entering the U.S. by personal automobile, you should check with your
            insurance agent to verify that your existing coverage is valid or sufficient for the
            areas you will be visiting and for the duration of your visit. If you are going to
            remain in a specific location in the U.S. for a considerable period of time, verify with
            the local authorities that your vehicle registration and driver\'s licence will remain
            valid.

            Many states have mandatory automobile insurance requirements, and many require motorists
            to carry appropriate proof of insurance. Each state\'s motor vehicles department can
            give you more specific information. The American Automobile Association and the Canadian
            Automobile Association can provide detailed information to their members.

            If you are in the U.S. and wish to drive to Mexico in your personal vehicle, you may
            need to purchase liability insurance as well as additional auto insurance. Contact your
            insurance agent and the local Mexican tourist office for further information. See our
            Travel Advice and Advisories for Mexico.
            Hitchhiking

            Never cross the border with a hitchhiker or as a hitchhiker. Though you may not be
            carrying anything illegal, the hitchhiker in your vehicle might be, and you could be
            implicated.

            Be equally careful about who and what you carry in your vehicle. As the driver, you
            could be held responsible for the misdeeds of your passengers, even if committed without
            your knowledge or involvement.
            Money

            The currency is the U.S. dollar (USD). Canadian currency, traveller\'s cheques in
            Canadian dollars, and personal cheques drawn on Canadian banks are not widely accepted
            or easily negotiable in the U.S. All major credit cards are accepted throughout the U.S.

            There are banking machines that will accept Canadian bank cards, but these may be
            limited depending on your account access. Despite these difficulties, do not carry large
            amounts of cash. Non-U.S. residents generally cannot negotiate monetary bank instruments
            (international bank drafts, money orders, etc.) without having a U.S. bank account.

            There is no limit to the amount of money that you may legally take into or out of the
            U.S.. However, if you carry more than US$10,000 in monetary instruments (such as U.S. or
            foreign coin, currency, traveller\'s cheques, money orders, stocks or bonds) into or out
            of the U.S., or if you receive more than that amount while in the U.S., you must file a
            report (Customs Form 4790) with U.S. Customs. Failure to comply can result in civil and
            criminal penalties, including seizure of the currency or monetary instruments.

            Illegal or restricted activities

            Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are strict. Convicted
            offenders can expect jail sentences and heavy fines.

            Religious proselytizing is illegal. It is punishable by penalties and/or imprisonment
            for up to 15 days and could lead to deportation.

            Homosexual activity is illegal. Convicted offenders may face jail sentences.

            Photography of public transportation is prohibited and may result in confiscation of
            equipment or detention.
            Dual citizenship

            Dual citizenship is not legally recognized, which may limit the ability of Canadian
            officials to provide consular services. You should travel using your Canadian passport
            and present yourself as Canadian to foreign authorities at all times.

            Canadians with Uzbek citizenship may be subject to national obligations, such as taxes.
            Check your status with the Embassy of the Republic of Uzbekistan in Washington, D.C.,
            prior to departure.

            See Travelling as a dual citizen for more information.
            Religion

            Islamic practices and beliefs are closely adhered to, particularly in rural areas. Dress
            conservatively, behave discreetly, and respect religious and social traditions to avoid
            offending local sensitivities.
            Money

            The currency is the Uzbek sum (UZS), which is used for most transactions. However, U.S.
            dollars can also be used. Carry bills in pristine condition, as well-worn or used U.S.
            banknotes may not be accepted. Only a few major hotels and restaurants accept credit
            cards. Traveller\'s cheques can only be cashed at the National Bank of Uzbekistan.
            Purchasing money on the black market is illegal and may result in extortion or jail
            sentences. There are no automated banking machines.

            screened for drugs by the Bolivarian National Guard.
            Laws

            Venezuela has strict regulations concerning the importation of foreign-registered motor
            vehicles. Offenders face heavy fines and/or confiscation of the vehicle. Before arrival,
            contact the Embassy of Venezuela for the most up-to-date regulations and procedures.

            Photography of sensitive installations, including the presidential palace, military
            sites, government buildings and airports, is prohibited.

            An International Driving Permit is recommended.
            Currency

            In 2008, the denomination of the Venezuelan currency changed from the bolÃ­var to the
            bolÃ­var fuerte (VEF), abbreviated locally as Bs.F. You should be aware of the value
            change: 1,000 bolÃ­vares correspond to 1 Bs.F.

            The law prohibits the sale and purchase of any foreign currency outside of authorized
            institutions, such as currency exchange houses or banks. Be wary of individuals trying
            to buy your dollars at the airport. Anyone caught exchanging foreign currency is subject
            to a fine. Banks often restrict transactions to their clients only. Exchange houses may
            be scarce outside of major cities.

            Only U.S. dollars can be exchanged, and only at official exchange houses. They cannot be
            used for transactions. If you are entering or leaving Venezuela with more than
            US$10,000, you are required to declare it to the authorities. Anyone convicted of
            selling or purchasing foreign currency above US$20,000 is subject to detention and a
            fine.

            The bolÃ­var fuerte cannot be exchanged outside Venezuela. For more information on
            currency exchange and international transactions, consult the ComisiÃ³n de
            AdministraciÃ³n de Divisas (in Spanish).

            Credit cards are generally accepted at major hotels, at resorts and at airports. Many
            stores do not accept international cards. Identification is required for any credit card
            transaction. Credit card fraud can occur.

            Visitors are not allowed to invite Vietnamese nationals of the opposite sex into their
            hotel rooms to stay overnight. Visitors are allowed to stay with a Vietnamese family,
            providing they have obtained permission from local authorities. It is the responsibility

            including jewellery, gold bar and raw gold, must also make a declaration.

            Vietnamese law restricts the export of antiques, but these laws are vague and unevenly
            enforced. If you purchase non-antique items of value, retain receipts and confirmation
            from shop owners and/or the Ministry of Culture and the Vietnam General Department of
            Customs to prevent seizure of your items upon departure.

            You must hold a valid Vietnamese driver\'s licence to drive a motor vehicle in Vietnam,

            hotels throughout the country, as well as at an increasing number of restaurants and
            shops. Automated banking machines are available throughout Vietnam.

            Illegal or restricted activities

            Religious proselytizing is not permitted.

            Common-law relationships, homosexual relations, adultery and prostitution are illegal
            and are subject to severe punishment.

            Avoid physical contact, including holding hands, in public.

            Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are strict.

            Public intoxication is a criminal offence, no matter where the alcohol was consumed.
            Consumption of alcohol outside approved venues is illegal and could result in arrest
            and/or fines and imprisonment. There is a zero tolerance policy regarding drinking and
            driving.

            It is forbidden to photograph military and police personnel and installations, and
            government buildings. Military sites are not always clearly marked. Do not photograph
            people without their permission.
            Customs

            Importation of alcohol is restricted, and prohibited to Muslims.

            Importing pork products and pornographic material and exporting antiquities are
            forbidden.
            Dual citizenship

            Dual citizenship is not legally recognized, which may limit the ability of Canadian
            officials to provide consular services. You should travel using your Canadian passport
            and present yourself as Canadian to foreign authorities at all times. Dual citizens may
            be subject to national obligations, such as military service and taxes. See Travelling
            as a dual citizen for more information.
            Family

            Canadian children or spouses may be prevented from leaving the country without prior
            authorization of the father/husband.

            Child custody decisions are based on Islamic law. It is extremely difficult for a
            Canadian woman, even if she is a Muslim, to obtain custody of her children through
            Yemeni courts.
            Dress and behaviour

            The country\'s customs, laws and regulations adhere closely to Islamic practices and
            beliefs. Dress conservatively, behave discreetly and respect religious and social
            traditions to avoid offending local sensitivities.
            Money

            The currency is the Yemeni rial (YER). The economy is primarily cash-based. Credit cards
            and traveller\'s cheques are accepted in some major hotels. Canadian currency and
            traveller\'s cheques are not accepted. Automated banking machines may only be available
            in major cities.
        </item>
        <item>Laws

            The possession or use of narcotics, including "soft" drugs such as marijuana, is
            strictly prohibited. Convicted offenders could face stiff penalties, including long jail
            sentences and/or deportation.

            Do not carry non-prescription medication containing diphenhydramine, such as Benadryl,
            as this ingredient is on the Zambian list of controlled substances. Some travellers have
            been charged with drug trafficking and have been incarcerated.

            Prescription medicine should always be carried in the original container along with a
            copy of the prescription; ensure that both the generic and trade names of the drug are
            included. A doctor\'s note describing why you are taking the medication is also
            recommended. Failure to do so could result in arrest and imprisonment.

            Homosexual activity is illegal.

            The possession of pornographic material is illegal in Zambia, and offenders may be
            jailed and/or deported.

            Avoid military zones. Photography of military installations is prohibited. Ask
            permission before photographing individuals.

            Traffic drives on the left. Turning left at a red light is prohibited. Penalties for
            drunk driving are severe.

            An International Driving Permit is recommended.
            Money

            The currency is the Zambian kwacha (ZMK). Canadian currency and traveller\'s cheques are
            not accepted anywhere in Zambia. You should carry cash in U.S. dollars, U.K. pounds, or
            South African rand. Major credit cards are accepted in larger supermarkets, restaurants,
            stores and hotels in large urban centres only.

            Illegal and restricted activities

            Demonstrations and assemblies, even for private meetings, are illegal in Zimbabwe if not
            pre-approved by the Government. Bystanders have been known to be taken into custody at
            such events. Police officers may request to attend meetings. Avoid large crowds or
            gatherings, particularly political meetings or rallies.

            Photography of government offices, airports, military establishments, official
            residences and embassies, in addition to other sensitive facilities, is prohibited
            unless permission is granted from the Zimbabwe Ministry of Information. Special permits
            may be needed for other photography. Laws are strictly enforced, and all restrictions
            should be observed. If in doubt, do not take a picture.

            It is a criminal offence in Zimbabwe to make derogatory or insulting comments about
            President Mugabe, a member of his government, or the Zimbabwean government itself. Any
            person making such comments is liable to arrest and prosecution. Avoid participating in
            political discussions in public places or engaging in political activity. Note that an
            open hand is the symbol of the main opposition political party, and that therefore a
            friendly wave could be misinterpreted as a provocative gesture. Avoid carrying books by
            banned authors, and in rural areas, do not carry copies of the main independent
            newspapers, such as the Financial Gazette, the Independent and the Standard.

            The use of a cellular telephone without using a hands-free device while driving is
            illegal and may result in a fine.

            Homosexual activity is illegal.

            Possession or importation of pornographic material is forbidden.
            Currency

            The payment of goods and services in Zimbabwe is now allowed in certain foreign
            currencies, including the U.S. dollar, South African rand and Botswana pula. The
            Zimbabwe dollar is no longer in use and is not accepted by stores.

            Remain cautious, as counterfeit notes can be found in circulation. For safety reasons,
            do not attempt to change currency at unregistered currency exchange offices or outlets.

            Most hotel charges for foreigners are based on a U.S. dollar rate and must be paid in
            cash from internationally convertible currency (typically U.S. dollars or British
            pounds). Credit cards are not widely accepted but some large vendors, such as
            supermarkets, may accept payment by credit card. Please note, not all Canadian credit
            cards are compatible with the local banking technology. Consult your travel agent or
            hotel in advance of your trip for details of your specific cards. Banks accept
            traveller\'s cheques for conversion to cash in foreign currency. Passport photocopies
            are not accepted by banks for monetary transactions. You will need to show your original
            piece of identification.

            It is not possible to use ABMs to withdraw U.S. dollars with a Canadian debit card.
            Foreign debit cards are not accepted at points of sale. Local cards which are part of
            the Zimswitch network may be accepted.

            You can send and receive money via Western Union in Zimbabwe. In addition, you can send
            and receive money using the local cellphone provider, Econet, by depositing money in an
            account at a local post office. Travellers leaving the country can take out up to
            US$5,000 cash or the equivalent in other foreign currencies. If you wish to take out
            additional foreign currency, you are required to seek permission from the Reserve Bank
            of Zimbabwe. Presently, there are no traveller\'s cheques in the country.

            Earthquakes

            Chile is located in an active seismic zone and is prone to earthquakes and tsunamis.
            Earthquakes can occur anywhere throughout Chile. Familiarize yourself with earthquake
            security measures in hotels and public and private buildings, and in the event of an
            earthquake, pay careful attention to all official warnings and evacuation orders issued
            by the Government of Chile.
            Flooding

            Flooding is frequent during autumn and winter (particularly between May and August)
            throughout the country, mainly as a result of heavy rains and overloaded sewage systems.
            Services and transport are often affected. Flooding from rising river levels after heavy
            rain can seriously damage property and cause injuries and deaths. You should avoid
            riverside accommodations, as dry riverbeds swell rapidly, particularly in central and
            southern Chile.

            On March 25th, 2014, heavy rain and flooding affected the northern regions of Chile. The
            red alert issued by the Chilean government at that time is still in effect. While
            transportation to and from northern Chile has resumed and reconstruction efforts are
            underway, continue to exercise caution, monitor local media and weather reports, and
            follow the advice of local authorities.
            Forest fires

            Forest fires often occur during the summer months. Even though they can happen anywhere,
            they usually affect the area comprised between Santiago/Valparaíso and the Magallanes.
            In the event of a major fire, you should follow the instructions of local emergency
            services, particularly with regard to evacuation procedures. Air quality in areas
            affected by fires may be poor. Monitor local media for updated information.
            Volcanoes

            There are 500 active volcanoes in Chile, and approximately 60 of them have erupted in
            the last 450 years. On March 3, 2015, Villarrica volcano in southern Chile erupted. If
            you live in or are travelling to areas near volcanoes, you should monitor activity
            levels closely.

            Debris from erupting volcanoes may clog rivers and cause them to overflow, which could
            in turn cause flash floods and landslides. Ash clouds may also cause disruptions to
            domestic and international flights. Monitor local media for current information, follow
            the advice of local authorities and consult the Oficina Nacional de Emergencia (in
            Spanish) for information on emergency procedures. Further information on volcanic
            monitoring is available from the Servicio Nacional de Geología y Minería (in Spanish).

            September. Dirt roads can become hazardous during these periods. After heavy rains, do
            not attempt to cross low-lying river bridges by car or on foot, as there have been
            fatalities linked to people being washed down river. Keep informed of regional weather
            forecasts and plan accordingly.

            Veld (bush) fires are common during dry seasons. They are very unpredictable and
            extremely dangerous. Veld fires can spread very quickly and travel at speeds of 60 km/h
            or more, due to high winds. Stay clear of any wildfire and always verify local
            conditions with relevant authorities before going on bush walks, particularly during the
            dry seasons.

            Terrorism

            Terrorism is a continuous threat throughout Afghanistan. The threat to foreigners,
            including Canadians, from terrorist and criminal violence is extremely high. Numerous
            attacks have occurred in reputable public areas, as well as against Afghan and
            international institutions. Attacks in Kabul occur often and are completely
            unpredictable. Terrorists’ targets include hotels, embassies, government buildings, and
            locations known to employ or be frequented by Westerners. No location in Afghanistan can
            be considered safe or exempt from the threat of attack. Be particularly vigilant in the
            lead-up to and on days of national significance. Violent incidents and protests may
            occur more frequently during the presidential election period. The first round of
            balloting took place April 5, 2014, and campaigns may take place until June.

            Tactics used by terrorists include Suicide bombs, rockets, improvised explosive devices,
            armed assaults, and ambushes. Exercise extreme caution at all times, particularly in
            public areas frequented by foreigners -such as hotels, restaurants, shops and
            marketplaces- and in the vicinity of public buildings, embassies and foreign companies’
            headquarters.
            Kidnapping

            There is an extreme risk of kidnapping for foreign nationals throughout Afghanistan.
            Numerous Westerners, including journalists and non-governmental organization workers,
            have been kidnapped and in some cases killed. Several organizations are behind these
            kidnappings, among them terrorists and criminal gangs. Kidnapping for ransom has become
            a very lucrative market in Afghanistan. Reports indicate that journalists may be lured
            to Afghanistan with offers of interviews, when the real purpose is to kidnap them.
            Crime

            Violent attacks against foreigners occur, including armed robbery and rape. Carjacking
            and robbery also occur. Weapons are easily available.
            Demonstrations

            Demonstrations, including anti-Western demonstrations, and civil unrest sometimes occur
            throughout Afghanistan. Some demonstrations have become violent, causing deaths and
            injuries. Political and socio-economic issues are usually causes for protests.

            Avoid all demonstrations and large gatherings, follow the advice of local authorities
            and monitor local media.
            Landmines

            Millions of landmines throughout the countryside pose a threat. No area can be
            considered safe.
            Road travel

            Overland travel outside of Kabul is extremely dangerous, and is restricted by the Afghan
            government to those who have armed security. Bogus checkpoints may be set up in order to
            commit attacks.

            Road travel should be carefully planned and only undertaken with others. Military and
            police forces are limited in rural areas. Banditry by armed groups is common. Many areas
            are controlled by warlords.

            Driving conditions are poor. Traffic is chaotic because traffic laws are non-existent or
            not enforced.
            Air travel

            Confirm your flight with your airline before going to the airport as the airport can
            close on short notice.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            General safety information

            Tourism is strongly discouraged.

            The security situation remains extremely volatile and unpredictable. If you must travel
            to Afghanistan, be extremely confident in your security arrangements; assess the risks
            of travelling before undertaking any trip, even in Kabul; monitor local developments
            closely; and register and keep in contact with the Embassy of Canada in Kabul. Carefully
            follow messages issued by the Embassy of Canada in Kabul through the Registration of
            Canadians Abroad service. Due to the unpredictable security situation, Canadian
            authorities may not be in a position to provide consular assistance in remote areas.

            Basic infrastructure services such as electricity and telephones are minimal, even in
            urban areas.

            Food and water shortages are common.

            Do not show signs of affluence or carry large sums of money. Ensure that your personal
            belongings, passports and other travel documents are secure at all times.

            Do not travel at night.
            Emergency services

            Dial 119 in Kabul for a 24-hour emergency service.

            Tropojë District and cities of Bajram Curri and Lazarat (see Advisory)

            Police assistance and protection is limited in Tropojë District and the city of Bajram
            Curri; incidents of carjacking have recently been reported in these areas. In and around
            the city of Lazarat, Albanian state police and armed marijuana growers have recently
            engaged in violent altercations.
            Northeastern border with Kosovo

            When visiting hill towns along Albania’s northeastern border with Kosovo, you should
            exercise caution and heed warning signs about unexploded landmines and ordnance from the
            Kosovo war of 1999. Demining operations are ongoing. This is especially important to
            note if you are hiking in the area.
            Crime

            Public security is usually good, particularly in Tirana. Petty crime (pickpocketing,
            mugging and bag snatching) occurs, particularly on public transportation.

            Women in particular should exercise caution when travelling alone. Avoid secluded areas,
            parks, bars and restaurants in remote areas, especially after dark.Consult our
            publication entitled Her Own Way: A Woman’s Safe-Travel Guide for travel safety
            information specifically aimed at Canadian women.

            Exercise caution in the northern districts of Has, Kukës and Tropojë. Criminal gangs
            operate along roads in remote areas, especially in the north and areas bordering
            Montenegro, Kosovo and Macedonia. Use caution in areas bordering Macedonia, as security
            is very poor.

            Economic hardship and easy availability of firearms increase the risk of violent
            incidents, carjacking and acts of looting. However, these actions do not typically
            involve tourists.

            Small explosive devices have been used in targeted attacks, including in Tirana in 2015.
            These incidents are normally attributed to internal disputes of a personal, business or
            political nature.
            Demonstrations

            Demonstrations occur in many Albanian centres and have the potential to suddenly turn
            violent. They can lead to significant disruptions to traffic and public transportation.
            Avoid all demonstrations and large gatherings, follow the advice of local authorities
            and monitor local media.
            Road travel

            Travel by road can be hazardous and difficult. Road signage and road safety are poor.
            The presence of erratic and aggressive drivers also poses risks. Major roads are
            passable, but secondary roads are often poorly maintained. Use a four-wheel-drive
            vehicle, even in urban centres. In winter, you may encounter dangerous snow and ice
            conditions on poorly maintained mountainous roads in northern and southeastern Albania.

            If possible, hire local drivers or taxis or use public transportation. Approved,
            privately owned vehicles, with drivers, can be hired for travel throughout the country.
            Pre-negotiate fares and schedules.

            Wait for police to arrive if you are involved in a road accident, even a minor one.

            Use only yellow taxis, which are normally parked at street corners in specific areas.
            Taxis only accept cash payment.

            Car rental companies are available in the main cities and offer a variety of services
            and vehicles.

            Travel outside the capital should be carefully planned and undertaken with the
            assistance of a reputable guide/interpreter or driver.
            Public transportation

            Buses, minibuses and trains operate between most major cities, but are unreliable and
            uncomfortable.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            Landmines

            Landmines and unexploded ordnance from the Kosovo war of 1999 remain. These areas are
            clearly identified in Albanian as danger zones or are surrounded by visible tape. Remain
            on paved roads and avoid ditches, open fields and the shoulders of roads. While most
            tourist destinations are not affected, you should seek local advice on the presence of
            unexploded landmines.
            General safety information

            Exercise normal safety precautions. Ensure that your personal belongings, passports and
            travel documents are secure at all times. Avoid showing signs of affluence and carrying
            large sums of cash.

            Power cuts occur frequently throughout Albania, in remote areas as well as in main
            cities. For your safety, always carry a flashlight while walking on the streets. Make
            arrangements for your well-being during outages and verify the schedule of power cuts
            with local authorities.
            Tourist facilities are not well developed, and many goods and services are not
            available.
            Emergency services

            Dial 129 for police.

            Increased threat of attacks and kidnappings

            In 2013, the French military assisted the Malian government in efforts to repel armed
            rebels. Terrorist groups in the region declared their intention to increase attacks and
            kidnappings targeting Westerners. While the United Nations peacekeeping mission in Mali
            has been supporting the transitional authorities in stabilizing the region since July
            2013, citizens of countries supporting the intervention are still at particular risk,
            but all travellers should exercise increased vigilance in the region.

            On 24 September 2014, a French national was kidnapped and murdered in Tizi Ouzou
            province by a group claiming allegiance to the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant
            (ISIL). On April 19, 2014, an attack by militants against the Algerian army in Tizi
            Ouzou left 11 soldiers dead. On January 16, 2013, terrorists attacked a Western oil
            operation in the region of In Amenas in the Sahara desert in order to take foreigners
            hostage. An estimated 37 hostages were killed in the attack. Canadian companies who are
            operating in remote areas of the wilayas of Adrar, Béjaïa, Bouïra, Boumerdès, El Oued,
            Illizi, Ouargla, Tamanrasset, Tébessa, Tindouf, and Tizi Ouzou should advise their
            employees to register with our Registration of Canadians Abroad service and closely
            follow the messages of the Embassy of Canada in Algeria.
            Travel outside major urban centres in Algeria (see Advisory)

            The security situation remains unpredictable. The threat of terrorism-related violence,
            including the use of improvised explosive devices, banditry, and kidnapping is high in
            the Kabylie region. Banditry and kidnappings have also taken place in outlying areas of
            Algeria. Terrorism-related incidentsand counter-insurgency operations occur regularly in
            the East and South of the country particularly in border areas..

            While Algerian security forces are the primary target in most terrorist attacks, some
            attacks have resulted in the death or injury of civilians. Monitor developments and
            follow the advice of local authorities.
            Terrorism

            Algerian authorities have succeeded in reducing, but not eliminating, terrorism-related
            violence over the last decade. Terrorism-related incidents, causing deaths and injuries,
            occur regularly, particularly in the Kabylie region southeast of Algiers, but also
            elsewhere in the north of the country. Algerian security forces are usually the primary
            target; however, other interests have also been targeted. The security situation
            continues to be unstable, and a number of planned incidents have been thwarted by
            authorities. While urban centres are reported to be more secure than heavily wooded and
            mountainous rural areas, there is a risk of being in the wrong place at the wrong time.

            On September 21, 2014, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) released a
            statement threatening retaliation for the American -led coalition campaign against ISIL
            in Iraq and Syria. The statement encouraged opportunistic and indiscriminate attacks
            against citizens and interests of countries supporting the coalition, including
            Canadians. Individuals and terrorist groups in the region may be inspired to carry out
            attacks in a show of solidarity with ISIL. Canadians could also be targeted by a
            terrorist attack and be considered kidnapping targets.

            Exercise a high degree of personal security awareness, maintain a heightened level of
            vigilance, remain aware of your surroundings, monitor news reports, follow the advice of
            local authorities and remain in contact with the Embassy of Canada in Algiers.
            Women\'s safety

            Women travelling alone may be subject to certain forms of harassment and verbal abuse.
            Consult our publication entitled Her Own Way: A Woman’s Safe-Travel Guide for travel
            safety information specifically aimed at Canadian women.
            Driving

            Road conditions can be poor outside of Algiers and signposts are rare. Rent a car with a
            driver rather than driving yourself. Traffic can be very congested, especially in large
            urban centres, and speeding and poor driving habits are prevalent. Traffic-related
            accidents have injured and killed a large number of people.

            Lock all belongings in the trunk and keep doors locked at all times. Park your car in a
            guarded parking lot.

            Checkpoints are set up on the main roads heading into and out of larger cities as well
            as throughout Algiers.

            Random terrorist or bandit roadblocks mean that all travellers, including foreigners, in
            rural Algeria are at risk of injury, robbery, kidnapping or murder. Be extremely
            vigilant at roadblocks and stop only for police in official uniforms.
            Public transportation

            Avoid using public transportation, including taxis, between the airport and the city
            centre, especially after dark. Make arrangements in advance to be picked up and dropped
            off at the airport by your hosts or by hotel shuttles.

            Avoid buses and trains completely as driving is generally hazardous and both have been
            targeted by terrorists and bandits.

            Taxis are not recommended as they generally service only the city centre and are not
            always available, especially late at night or at peak hours. Also, they are not
            dispatched to pick up single clients – they follow a standard route and pick up many
            clients going in the same direction.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            Desert travel

            Use a reputable tour operator, accompanied by a professional guide, and obtain
            permission from the Algerian authorities if you are planning on travelling to the Sahara
            despite the warning that is in effect (see Advisory). You should also register with the
            Embassy of Canada in Algiers and contact the Embassy for information and advice.

            In the Sahara, the extreme climate, the lack of water and infrastructure, and the
            visibility of Algeria\'s petroleum and gas industry (which is well guarded by both the
            Algerian military and private security services) create a different security
            environment. Tours organized by reputable tour operators in the region are considered
            safer; however, the risk of groups being targeted by terrorists and bandits always
            exists.
            General safety information

            Remain vigilant at all times. You should be briefed on hotel security measures on
            arrival. Retain your hotel key at all times.

            Limit travel on foot, especially at night.

            Security forces are present throughout the country on roads, at the airport, and in
            front of government buildings. Fully cooperate with security personnel at all times.

            Crime

            Petty and violent crime occurs on occasion. Ensure that your personal belongings,
            passports and other travel documents are secure at all times.
            Transportation

            Traffic drives on the right. Roads are generally in poor condition. Buses and taxis are
            available.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            General safety information

            You are encouraged to register with the High Commission of Australia in Apia, Samoa, in
            order to receive the latest information on situations and events that could affect your
            safety.

            Stray dogs are a problem. Do not approach or feed them as they can become aggressive.

            Tidal changes can cause powerful currents in the many coastal lagoons that surround the
            islands, and several fatal swimming accidents are recorded each year. Consult local
            residents and tour operators for information on possible hazards and on safe swimming
            areas.
        </item>
        <item>
            Crime

            The crime rate is low. Exercise normal safety precautions and ensure that your personal
            belongings, passports and other travel documents are secured at all times.
            Road travel

            There are no major highways. Narrow, winding mountain roads pose risks year-round and
            may be impassable in winter.
            Emergency services

            Dial 110 to reach police, 118 for ambulance and firefighters, 112 for mountain rescue
            and 116 in the event of a medical emergency.

            Province of Cabinda (see Advisory)

            Militant groups claiming independence are active in this province, and clashes with
            security forces are possible. Murders, kidnappings and sexual assaults have occurred and
            foreigners have been targeted. These militant groups have indicated their intention to
            continue to conduct attacks on foreigners. Access to basic goods and services is
            restricted in Cabinda.
            Province of Lunda Norte (see Advisory)

            The presence of foreigners in this diamond-producing area may create some tensions, and
            security forces engaged in the expulsion of illegal diamond miners may be suspicious of
            foreign observers. The presence of diamonds increases levels of crime. Travellers may be
            asked for a letter from their employer, an organization or an individual explaining the
            reasons for their travel. Access to basic goods and services is restricted in Lunda
            Norte.
            Crime

            Crime is a concern throughout the country, including in the capital, Luanda, where it is
            a regular occurrence. Areas frequented by foreigners are often targeted. Do not walk
            around Luanda after dark. Muggings (particularly for mobile phones) and armed robberies
            have been reported. Carjackings, usually targeting four-wheel drive and luxury vehicles,
            occur. Pickpockets are active outside the arrivals and departures gates at the Luanda
            airport. Incidents of rape have been reported.

            Do not show signs of affluence. When withdrawing money, whether from an automated
            banking machine (ABM), an exchange bureau or a bank, be aware that criminals with phones
            may be observing, even from inside the building, and may attack you afterward.

            Be vigilant when travelling after dark, particularly to and from the airport. You should
            not resist if threatened by carjackers or robbers. Do not make eye contact with
            assailants or indicate that you might be able to identify them.

            Due to the high prevalence of HIV/AIDS, victims of violent crime, especially rape, are
            strongly encouraged to seek immediate medical assistance.
            Demonstrations

            Demonstrations occasionally occur and could turn violent without warning. You should
            avoid large crowds, follow the advice of security forces and monitor the local media for
            up-to-date information.
            Landmines

            There is a high risk from landmines and unexploded ordnance, especially near bridges and
            on unpaved roads outside major cities. Many areas of the countryside, including
            secondary roads, are heavily mined. Even roads that have been frequently travelled and
            are thought to be landmine-free may be unsafe.
            Road travel

            Roads, especially secondary and tertiary roads, and bridges are generally in poor
            condition. Incidents of drivers under the influence of alcohol are common, especially on
            weekends, and the return trip to Luanda from beach outings can be particularly hazardous
            due to reckless driving habits. Be extremely careful of unexpected hazards on the road,
            such as pedestrians and animals.

            Always drive with the doors locked and the windows rolled up. Keep your valuables out of
            sight.
            Overland travel outside of urban centres should be undertaken in convoys of at least two
            vehicles, ideally four-wheel drive vehicles.

            Door-to-door taxis are scarce and expensive, so it is advisable to hire a car with
            driver. Local drivers can overcome the problem of few parking spaces and can negotiate
            heavy traffic and the idiosyncrasies of local traffic flows, including any accident.

            It is recommended that visitors avoid using public transportation, including buses and
            van taxis.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            General security information

            You should be careful at all times and carry locally certified copies of the
            identification page of your passport as well as original travel documents issued by
            Angolan authorities, such as resident or work permits, visas and driver’s licence. Make
            sure your documents are up-to-date. Police checkpoints are common in both urban and
            rural areas. You should be prepared to present copies of your identification documents.
            Do not challenge the authority of requesting officials. Failure to produce
            identification documents can result in a large fine.

            When travelling in the provinces, always carry original documentation. If photocopies
            are to be used in place of originals, the copies must be notarized by an Angolan notary
            public. Note that notarized photocopies are normally not acceptable for travel outside
            Luanda.

            Foreigners travelling into the interior of Angola sometimes require an internal travel
            document. This is normally provided by the Angolan organization or individual that
            invited the foreigner to Angola.

            Shortages of food, lodging, medicine, transportation, electricity, fuel and water
            occasionally occur in most parts of the country. While Luanda does not experience
            shortages of food, lodging is scarce and tourist facilities are very expensive; the cost
            of living in Luanda is very high.

            Poisonous snakes are a potential danger in the countryside.
            Telecommunications

            Interruptions in telecommunications are common. International calls are difficult to
            place from outside the capital. Most personal cellular phones are incompatible and must
            be reprogrammed for use within Angola.
            Emergency assistance

            In case of an emergency, dial 113. Please note that you should speak Portuguese.
        </item>
        <item>
            Crime

            Exercise common sense and normal security precautions, as petty crime and drug-related
            crime do occur. Victims of robbery may be physically assaulted if they resist. Avoid
            beaches and unpopulated areas after dark. Ensure that your personal belongings and
            passports and other travel documents are secure at all times.
            Spiked food and drinks

            Never leave food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers. Be wary of accepting
            snacks, beverages, gum, or cigarettes from new acquaintances, as they may contain drugs
            that could put you at risk of sexual assault and robbery.
            Road travel

            Traffic drives on the left. Some roads may be inadequately paved and narrow.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            Emergency services

        <item>
            Crime

            Petty crime and armed assaults against tourists can occur. Take necessary precautions
            and remain vigilant. Avoid deserted and unpatrolled beaches after dark. Check with local
            authorities to determine which beaches are safe. Do not carry large sums of cash or wear
            jewellery. Ensure valuables, passports and other travel documents are secure at all
            times.
            Road travel

            Traffic drives on the left. Main roads are well maintained, though street lights are
            uncommon and there is a lack of signage. Wild animals may stray into traffic. For more
            information on road conditions and traffic safety, consult the Department of Tourism

            Crime

            Distraction thefts commonly occur in popular tourist areas and in public areas such as
            bus and train stations, the subway system, airports, restaurants, hotel lobbies and
            Wi-Fi hotspots. Pickpockets and bag snatchers often work in pairs and employ a variety
            of ruses. A common scam involves spraying a substance on victims and then robbing them
            while pretending to help clean the stain, or distracting the victim by asking questions
            while another person perpetrates the theft.

            Ensure that your personal belongings, passports and other travel documents are secure at
            all times. Carry a photocopy of your passport for identification purposes. Do not show
            signs of affluence and do not carry large amounts of money. Remain aware of your
            surroundings when using automated banking machines (ABMs) and avoid using them at night.
            Avoid walking alone after dark, especially in the downtown areas of major cities.

            Though not common, armed robberies and home break-ins may occur. While most victims are
            not physically injured, criminals usually do not hesitate to use force if they are
            confronted. In this event, you should hand over your cash and valuables without
            resistance.

            Express kidnappings involving tourists have occurred in Argentina. Victims of express
            kidnappings are usually abducted for a few hours and forced to withdraw money from
            automated banking machines in order to be released. Use only radio-taxis—preferably
            booked in advance—and do not share taxis with strangers.

            If you are planning to attend a soccer game, ensure that the stadium is located in a
            safe area and monitor news reports to determine if violence is expected to occur during
            or following the game.

            In Buenos Aires, be cautious in all tourist areas, particularly in La Boca, San Telmo,
            Congreso and Retiro. In La Boca, remain on main tourist streets, and avoid the area
            after dark.

            In Mendoza, crime has increased considerably, with some incidents involving violence. Be
            cautious and alert at all times, and avoid walking in unpopulated areas at night.

            When travelling to Iguazú Falls, exercise caution when crossing the tri-border area
            between Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay where criminal activities are known to occur.
            Avoid crossing these borders in local taxis or buses after dark.
            Demonstrations

            Demonstrations, roadblocks and strikes may occur throughout the country at any time,
            which may result in transportation disruptions. Monitor local news reports for
            information on the area you are planning to visit. Avoid demonstrations and never
            attempt to cross blockades, even if they appear unattended.
            Public transportation

            Watch out for pickpockets when using public transportation, particularly the subway
            system. You should use a "remise" (private car with driver) for travel to and from
            Buenos Aires\' Ezeiza International Airport. The best way to obtain a remise is to call
            for one or go to an established remise stand at the airport or hotel. Call radio-taxis
            instead of hailing taxis on the street, particularly in Buenos Aires. If hailing a taxi,
            ensure that it is marked "radio-taxi" and that the company\'s name and telephone number
            are clearly visible. Do not share taxis with strangers. Carry small bills to pay for
            taxi fares.
            Road travel

            Pedestrians, cyclists and drivers should exercise extreme caution in Argentina, as it
            has one of the highest traffic accident rates in the world. Many drivers ignore traffic
            lights and speed limits.

            Be particularly vigilant when stopped at traffic lights. Keep windows closed and doors
            locked at all times.
            Air travel

            Domestic flights are frequently delayed or rescheduled as a result of work stoppages and
            technical problems at the airports.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            Trekking:

            If you intend to trek:

            a) never trek alone;
            b) always hire an experienced guide and ensure that the trekking company is reputable;
            c) buy travel health insurance that includes helicopter rescue and medical evacuation;
            d) ensure that you are in top physical condition;
            e) advise a family member or friend of your itinerary;
            f) know the symptoms of acute altitude sickness, which can be fatal;
            g) register with the Embassy of Canada in Argentina; and
            h) obtain detailed information on trekking routes before setting out.

            Prior to ascending Mount Aconcagua, contact the Subsecretaria de Turismo de San Martín

            Nagorno-Karabakh and the surrounding areas (see Advisory)

            The border with Azerbaijan, including the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic of Azerbaijan,
            is closed. A ceasefire has been in effect since May 1994, although armed clashes and
            gunfire along the 5-km buffer zone between the border and the ceasefire line occur
            sporadically. There are many landmines surrounding the conflict zones with
            Nagorno-Karabakh.
            Border areas

            Be particularly vigilant near all land borders. As the land border with Turkey is
            closed, you should only travel between Yerevan and Istanbul by air.
            Crime

            Pickpocketing, mugging and theft from cars and homes occur. Do not show signs of
            affluence.
            Demonstrations

            Demonstrations occur and have the potential to suddenly turn violent. They can lead to
            significant disruptions to traffic and public transportation. Avoid all demonstrations
            and large gatherings, follow the advice of local authorities and monitor local media.
            Public transportation

            Public transportation networks are overcrowded and poorly maintained.

            Pedestrians may not have the right of way.

            Minibuses are often involved in accidents.

            Some roads outside Yerevan are poorly maintained. Do not travel after dark. Poor driving
            standards, inadequate road signs and poor road conditions make road travel hazardous.
            Winter travel can be extremely hazardous at higher elevations. Police may set up
            roadblocks to search vehicles.

            Be cautious when travelling by train. Store personal belongings and documents in a safe
            place, do not leave the compartment unattended and lock the door from the inside.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            General safety information

            Armenian authorities conduct frequent identity checks. Carry a photocopy of your
            passport and leave another one with a relative or a friend at home. Keep passports and
            valuables in a safe.

            Arrange to be met at the airport.
            Emergency services

            Dial 101 for the fire department, 102 for the police and 103 for ambulance services.

            Crime

            Petty crime can occur. Ensure that your personal belongings, passports and other travel
            documents are secure at all times. Avoid unpopulated areas or unpatrolled beaches after
            dark. Check with local authorities to determine which beaches are patrolled.
            Road travel

            Major roads are in good condition, but road signs are rare. Wandering animals are a
            hazard. Driving is on the right side of the road, and turning right on red lights is
            prohibited.
            Public transportation

            Taxis do not have meters. Agree on a fare prior to departure.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.

        <item>
            Crime

            Violent crime is low, but petty crime such as pickpocketing and bag snatching occurs in
            larger cities. Vehicle break-ins are common. Exercise caution in the more popular
            tourist areas (St. Kilda in Melbourne; Kings Cross, downtown George Street, Darling
            Harbour, Bondi Beach and The Rocks, in Sydney; Cairns and the Gold Coast, in
            Queensland), where thieves target foreigners. Hitchhiking should be avoided at all
            times, and women should not travel alone after dark.

            Never leave food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers. Be wary of accepting
            snacks, beverages, gum, or cigarettes from new acquaintances, as they may contain drugs
            that could put you at risk of sexual assault and robbery.

            Attacks on backpackers have occurred. Ensure that your personal belongings are secure,
            particularly in crowded places. Robberies of safe-deposit facilities are common at
            inexpensive hotels and hostels.
            Terrorism

            In September 2014, the Government of Australia raised its National Terrorism Public
            Alert level from Medium to High due to a perceived increase in the likelihood of a
            terrorist attack in the country. Visit the website of the Australian National Security
            for more information. Continue to exercise normal security precautions.
            Transportation

            Traffic drives on the left. Exercise caution when driving in rural areas, particularly
            in the Northern Territory, due to roaming animals, excessive speeding and "road-trains"
            (trucks pulling two or more trailers). Pull over and allow oncoming road-trains to pass
            to avoid being sideswiped. Access to some remote locations may be impossible during
            inclement weather. When travelling by car, plan your route carefully due to the great
            distances between settlements and the isolation of many outback areas. Provide a friend
            or relative with your itinerary, and ensure that your vehicle is in good repair. Carry
            sufficient supplies of gasoline, water and food, as well as a cellular telephone.
            Permits are required when travelling on aboriginal territory.

            Public transportation is safe and reliable.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            Remote areas

            Many regions in the interior of Australia are remote, with small populations and few
            services. Overland travellers may have limited access to telephones and other
            facilities. Flash floods and bushfires occur in many parts of the country. Monitor news
            reports carefully. For more information, consult the publication entitled National
            Visitor Safety Handbook published by Tourism Queensland.
            Swimming

            Riptides in coastal areas can be strong, including at popular tourist destinations.
            Several drownings occur each year. Obey the lifeguards, heed flag warnings and under no
            circumstances swim when a red flag is displayed.

            Crime

            The crime rate in Austria is low. However, petty crime (pickpocketing, bag snatching) is
            increasing, particularly in Vienna. Pickpockets are active in pedestrian shopping areas,
            restaurants, cafés, hotel lobbies and train stations, aboard public transport and at
            tourist attractions. International night trains travelling to and from Austria are often
            targeted by thieves. Exercise caution around city parks and subway stations after dark.
            Demonstrations

            Demonstrations occur and can lead to significant disruptions to traffic and public
            transportation. They have turned violent in the past on rare occasion. Avoid all
            demonstrations and large gatherings, follow the advice of local authorities and monitor
            local media.
            Road travel

            Road conditions are generally good. Mountain roads are often narrow and covered with
            snow and ice during winter. Roads may close due to avalanches. Carry tire chains in the
            car if you intend to use mountain roads.
            Public transportation

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            Mountain activities

            Towns and ski resorts may be snowed in and roads made impassable after heavy snowfalls.
            Avalanches present risks, especially following huge snowfalls. Some have resulted in
            deaths.

            If you intend to do mountaineering or ski touring:

            a) never practice these activities alone;

            b) always hire an experienced guide from a reputable company;

            c) buy travel health insurance that includes helicopter rescue and medical evacuation;

            d) ensure you are in top physical condition;

            e) advise a family member or friend of your itinerary and when you expect to be back;

            f) know the symptoms of acute altitude sickness, which can be fatal;

            g) register with the Embassy of Canada in Austria; and

            h) obtain detailed information on trekking routes or ski slopes before setting out.

            Do not venture off established trails, especially in early or late winter. Austrian
            authorities have also warned skiers not to leave marked slopes.

            You are advised to visit the Austrian National Tourist Office website for information on
            weather and safety conditions. Advice should be followed carefully.

            Take note of the coordinates of the Embassy of Canada in Vienna, to contact in the event
            of an emergency.
            General safety information

            Exercise normal safety precautions. Ensure personal belongings, passports and other
            travel documents are secure at all times, especially on public transportation.

            Nagorno-Karabakh and the surrounding areas (see Advisory)

            The border with Armenia is a closed military zone because of the unresolved dispute over
            Nagorno-Karabakh. Despite the ceasefire, in effect since 1994, armed clashes along the
            border with Armenia and the ceasefire line continue. There are numerous landmines in the
            conflict zones.
            Crime

            Muggings can occur at night in Baku around popular nightlife spots and in dimly lit
            areas. Avoid walking alone after dark, do not carry large amounts of cash, and do not
            display signs of affluence. Keep valuables, passports and other travel documents in a
            secure place.
            Demonstrations

            Demonstrations occur and have the potential to suddenly turn violent. They can lead to
            significant disruptions to traffic and public transportation. Avoid all demonstrations
            and large gatherings, follow the advice of local authorities and monitor local media.
            Transportation

            Poor driving standards, badly maintained cars, and insufficient lighting make highway
            travel dangerous outside of Baku. Pedestrians should exercise caution.

            Public transportation is poorly maintained, often overcrowded, and unsafe, especially
            outside of Baku. Avoid the Baku metro, especially after dark.

            Only use officially marked, “purple”, taxis, which are metered, have seatbelts, and are
            cheaper than unmarked taxis. Avoid shared taxis.

            Avoid long-distance travel by train. If travel by train is necessary, store personal
            belongings in a safe place and do not leave the compartment unattended. Ensure the door
            is secured from the inside.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            General safety information

            Carry adequate identification at all times. Keep a photocopy of your passport in case of
            loss or seizure.

            Tourist facilities are limited outside of Baku, Kuba, Lenkoran, and the Abpsheron
            Peninsula on the coast of the Caspian Sea.

            Crime

            The crime rate is low in the Azores and petty crime, such as theft and pickpocketing, is
            uncommon.

            In some areas, streets may be poorly lit and deserted at night. Be vigilant and avoid
            walking alone after dark.
            Beaches and water activities

            While beaches are generally considered safe, do not leave your personal belongings
            unattended.

            During the summer months, deaths by drowning have occurred on beaches and in swimming
            pools. Take warning flags on beaches seriously. The Maritime Police have the authority
            to fine bathers who disobey the lifeguard’s warning flags. Don’t swim at beaches that
            link to/from rivers, as the water currents can be very strong. Don’t dive into unknown
            water, as hidden rocks or shallow depths can cause serious injury or death.

            In the fall and winter months, be cautious when walking along beaches close to the
            water’s edge because waves can be very unpredictable in size and may come onto shore
            further than expected and with strong undertows. Do not visit beaches or coastal areas
            during periods of severe weather warnings. Exercise caution and follow the advice of
            local authorities.

            Look out for signs warning of cliff erosion. Falling rocks are a hazard and the
            authorities can fine those who ignore warning signs.

            In marine areas, coral, jellyfish and other ocean life found along reefs can poison,
            sting or cause infection if touched or stepped on. Ask local authorities about the
            presence of such species and whether they are dangerous.
            Transportation

            Exercise caution on country roads, due to blind curves and corners as well as hidden
            driveways.

            Taxis are equipped with meters, although they may not always be visible. Ask for
            receipts.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.

            Crime

            Crime occurs mainly in Nassau and Freeport. There has been an increase in armed
            robberies targeting tourists in Nassau. Incidents take place in populated and isolated
            areas, and even in daylight hours. Do not carry large sums of cash or wear expensive
            jewellery. Ensure that your personal belongings, passports and other travel documents
            are secure at all times. If you are threatened by robbers, stay calm and do not resist.
            Home invasions are also of concern in Nassau.

            Stay alert to your surroundings at all times, even in areas normally considered safe.
            Avoid deserted beaches and do not walk alone, particularly after dark. Sexual assaults
            are on the rise in Nassau.

            Be cautious and mindful of the risks to your personal safety when partaking in
            recreational water activities. Foreigners have reportedly been sexually assaulted by
            water sports rental operators. Tourists have been seriously injured using jet skis and
            other watercraft due to the poorly regulated water sports rental industry in the
            Bahamas.
            Road travel

            Traffic drives on the left. Road conditions are different from those in Canada. Traffic
            accidents frequently result in injuries and death. Roads are generally adequate in
            Nassau and Freeport, but road travel is limited elsewhere. Road construction is not
            always well marked. Bicycles, mopeds and pedestrians can be hazards, particularly on the
            busy streets of Nassau and Freeport.
            Air travel

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            General safety information

            Rent water sports equipment only from reputable operators, inquire about insurance
            coverage, and insist on proper training before using the equipment.

            Terrorism

            On September 21, 2014, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) released a
            statement threatening retaliation for the American -led coalition campaign against ISIL
            in Iraq and Syria. The statement encouraged opportunistic and indiscriminate attacks
            against citizens and interests of countries supporting the coalition, which includes
            Canada. Individuals and terrorist groups in the region may be inspired to carry out
            attacks in a show of solidarity with ISIL. Exercise a high degree of personal security
            awareness at all times, maintain a heightened level of vigilance and be aware of your
            surroundings.

            Attacks may occur in and around Manama, and would likely target government buildings,
            public areas, tourist sites or Western interests. Increased security measures are
            currently in place and may be reinforced upon short notice.

            Maintain a high level of vigilance and personal security awareness at all times,
            exercise caution in areas that foreigners likely frequent (such as commercial districts,
            movie theatres and tourist areas including hotels, bars and nightclubs). Monitor local
            developments and follow the advice of local authorities. Register with, and carefully
            follow messages issued through, the Registration of Canadians Abroad service.
            Demonstrations

            Since 2011, civil unrest involving violent altercations has occurred in many parts of
            Bahrain, and could potentially spread throughout the rest of the island. Demonstrations
            occur regularly and may become violent.

            Avoid all political gatherings, crowds and demonstrations, and stay away from areas
            where they can occur. Foreigners participating in protests or even being found in the
            vicinity of protesters may be subject to arrest with serious consequences, including a
            jail sentence.

            Monitor local media and road closure announcements.
            Crime

            Petty crime, such as purse snatching and pickpocketing, occurs. Violent crime is rare.
            Exercise caution in the old market areas (souks), villages and poorer districts,
            especially after dark.
            Transportation

            Driving habits differ markedly from those practised in Canada. Drifting sands and
            roaming animals can pose hazards.

            In the event of an accident resulting in injuries, do not move your vehicle until a
            report has been filed, even though it may impede traffic. If there are injuries, call
            999; if there are no injuries, call 199.

            Off-road driving can be hazardous. Only go off-road driving in a convoy of
            four-wheel-drive vehicles and with an experienced guide. Leave your travel itinerary
            with a family member or friend. Be well-prepared by equipping yourself with extra
            gasoline, water, food and a cellular phone.

            Taxis are generally safe. Use only officially marked taxis. Negotiate fares in advance,
            or insist that the driver use the meter, as you may be overcharged.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            Women’s safety

            Women travellers have been subject to physical and verbal harassment. Consult our
            publication, Her Own Way: A Woman’s Safe-travel Guide, for travel safety information for
            Canadian women.
            General safety information

            Leave your passport in a safe place and carry a photocopy for identification purposes.

            Cellular phone coverage may not be available in some parts of the country.
            Emergency services

            Dial 999 for police, ambulance and fire emergencies.

            Demonstrations, hartals, blockades and politically motivated violence

            The security situation is fluid and could deteriorate quickly. Closely monitor local
            news sources for information. Political demonstrations, nationwide hartals (enforced
            strikes), blockades and violent clashes are occurring frequently and are expected to
            continue. The security situation could deteriorate quickly.

            Hartals can effectively shut down all businesses and disrupt transportation, including
            in the diplomatic/expatriate areas. Passengers at Hazrat Shah Jalal International
            Airport may be stranded without transportation. During hartals and blockades, travel
            within Dhaka outside the Gulshan, Baridhara and Banani areas and all travel outside
            Dhaka is strongly discouraged due to the high incidence of violence. Road 86 north of
            the Gulshan 2 circle, as well as Road 79 at the corner of Gulshan Avenue, should be
            avoided during hartals, demonstrations or during election periods as large gatherings
            are frequently held there, making it difficult to pass safely.

            During periods of hartals and blockades, be particularly vigilant in Dhaka around the
            Parliament building, the Secretariat Area, the National Mosque, Dhaka University, Purana
            Paltan, Naya Paltan, Motijheel, Mirpur, Kawran Bazar and Shahbag. Explosive devices and
            firearms have been used during confrontations between groups including rival political
            factions, police and demonstrators. Be aware of the potential for sudden demonstrations
            and violent clashes following Juma prayers (after noon) on Fridays.

            Avoid all demonstrations and large gatherings, as well as areas where they are taking
            place, keep well informed of the situation as it unfolds by monitoring local news
            reports and follow the advice of local authorities.

            Avoid travelling during blockades as road, rail and marine transportation may be
            attacked or blocked. Prepare to have sufficient food, water and fuel available as
            shortages may occur.

            Previous violent demonstrations have resulted in several hundred reported deaths.
            Attacks using explosive devices occurred in crowded public places, hotels, movie
            theatres, railway stations, and at political rallies in cities such as Dhaka, Sylhet,
            Khulna, and Chittagong. During blockades, protesters set fire to vehicles, including
            trains, and damaged railway tracks, leading to derailments and injuries. Fire bombs
            thrown at a bus on February 3, 2015, left seven people dead and 16 injured. Such
            violence could take place again if the security situation deteriorates and disturbances
            resume.
            Chittagong Hill Tracts region (see Advisory)

            You should register at the Divisional Commissioner’s Office in Chittagong City before
            making your way to the Chittagong Hill Tracts region. Exercise extreme caution, maintain
            a high level of personal security awareness at all times, monitor local developments,
            and avoid crowds and demonstrations.
            Crime

            Violent crimes such as armed robberies and rapes occur. Foreigners are not particularly
            targeted, though crimes of opportunity have taken place against them in various areas,
            including Dhaka, Chittagong, Sylhet, Feni and Khulna.

            Pickpocketing, purse snatching and mugging are common and have increased recently,
            especially in areas frequented by tourists and expatriates. Thieves target rickshaw, CNG
            (motorized rickshaw) and taxi passengers, particularly around dusk. They are also
            present on trains.

            Cases of abduction for ransom have occurred, though they rarely involve foreigners.

            Exercise caution when travelling outside urban areas. Do not show signs of wealth and do
            not wear jewellery. Ensure that your personal belongings, passports and other travel
            documents are secure at all times.

            Avoid walking alone or taking public transportation after dark. Victims of crime should
            contact the High Commission of Canada in Dhaka for assistance before filing a police
            report.
            Women’s safety

            Unaccompanied women face the highest risk of being victims of crime. Physical and verbal
            harassment of women occurs. Avoid travelling alone, including on public transportation,
            especially at night. Do not go to police stations alone. Consult our publication
            entitled Her Own Way: A Woman’s Safe-Travel Guide for travel safety information
            specifically aimed at Canadian women.
            Forced Marriage

            Canadians have been forced into marriage without their prior knowledge or consent. For
            more information, consult our Forced Marriage page and our publication entitled Her Own
            Way: A Woman’s Safe-Travel Guide.
            Scams

            Travellers have reported being scammed by security officials in the departures section
            of the Hazrat Shah Jalal International Airport in Dhaka. During security pat downs at
            the boarding gate, security officials have asked travellers if they had any money in
            their pockets. When travellers presented local currency, they were advised that it is
            illegal to export Bangladeshi taka and were asked to turn over their money. If you are
            confronted with this situation, you should refuse to comply and ask to speak with the
            Chief of Airport Security. You are also encouraged to report such incidents to the High
            Commission of Canada in Dhaka.
            Transportation

            Traffic drives on the left. Road conditions are poor. Road travel is dangerous and
            should be avoided after dark since many vehicles operate without headlights or with full
            high beams. Traffic in urban areas is extremely congested and chaotic. Road accidents
            causing injuries or death are common.

            Ferries and long-distance buses on major roads between towns have been targeted by gangs
            of thieves. Exercise caution when using these means of transportation. Ferry accidents
            are not uncommon in Bangladesh due to the overloading and poor maintenance of some
            vessels. Do not board vessels that appear overloaded or unseaworthy.

            Rail travel is slow and derailments occur. Ensure your compartment is locked when
            travelling at night.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            General safety information

            Tourist facilities are inadequate.

            The work week in Bangladesh is from Sunday to Thursday.

            Planned power cuts, termed “load shedding,” are a common daily occurrence in most parts
            of the country and can last for many hours. Water is also not supplied on a consistent
            basis and several areas of the country can go for days without any water.
            Piracy

            Pirate attacks occur in coastal waters and, in some cases, farther out at sea. Mariners
            should take appropriate precautions. For additional information, consult the Live Piracy
            Report published by the International Maritime Bureau.

            Crime

            Petty crime is common and incidents of violent crime occur. Crimes against tourists, as
            well as incidents involving firearms, have been reported. Foreigners have also been the
            target of rape. Avoid unattended or isolated areas, including beaches, at any time. Be
            particularly vigilant when visiting Long Beach, where assaults and robberies have been
            reported.

            Arrange secure living accommodations and do not carry large amounts of cash or
            jewellery. Leave personal belongings and travel documents in a safety deposit box or
            secure hotel safe.
            Road travel

            Traffic drives on the left. Roads are narrow and poorly lit. Road signs are scarce.
            There are many pedestrians and cyclists, and few sidewalks. Roadside assistance is not
            widely available. Locating a phone booth in rural areas may be difficult. Seatbelt laws
            are strictly enforced.
            Public transportation

            Buses and vans are often crowded and travel at high speed. Although standard fares exist
            for some destinations, taxis are not metered. Confirm the fare with the driver before
            departing.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            Emergency services

            In case of an emergency, dial 211 for the police, and 511 for an ambulance. Police and
            ambulance response can be slow.
        </item>
        <item>
            Crime

            Petty crimes such as pickpocketing, purse snatching and mugging occur, particularly in
            the cities of Minsk, Grodno, Brest, Gomel, Mogilev, and Vitebsk. Such crimes are
            especially common after dark in and around hotels and hostels frequented by foreigners.

            Theft is common on trains, particularly on sleeper trains. Be vigilant when crossing the
            border with Poland at Brest due to the risk of mugging.

            Theft of luxury cars is common. Park your vehicle in a secure location or guarded lot
            and always keep valuables out of sight.
            Demonstrations

            Demonstrations periodically occur in the capital, Minsk, and other major cities in
            Belarus, following the presidential elections held in December 2010. Clashes with police
            occur and hundreds of people, including passers-by, have been detained, fined or
            sentenced to jail terms. Avoid all demonstrations and large gatherings as they have the
            potential to suddenly turn violent. Follow the advice of local authorities and monitor
            local media.
            Terrorism

            On April 11, 2011, an explosion took place in a Minsk subway station, killing 14 and
            injuring more than 200 people. You are advised to use extreme caution when using the
            public transportation system.
            Fraud

            Automated banking machine (ABM) card and credit-card fraud is common. Use these cards
            only at ABMs located inside major banks. If you use a credit card for payment, pay
            careful attention when it is being handled by others during payment processing and check
            your statement frequently for fraudulent use.

            See our Overseas Fraud page for more information on scams abroad.
            Spiked food and drinks

            Never leave food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers. Be wary of accepting
            snacks, beverages, gum, or cigarettes from new acquaintances, as they may contain drugs
            that could put you at risk of sexual assault and robbery. Many adult clubs are managed
            by organized crime.
            Road travel

            Roads are generally in good condition; however, many may be impassable in winter.
            Drivers generally have little regard for traffic regulations and do not follow
            safe-driving practices. Horse-drawn carts are a common road hazard in rural areas. Radar
            traps are widespread.

            The Belarusian government may enforce a requirement for special permits to travel in
            “protected border zones.” Information defining the parameters of those zones has not
            been provided. Be alert for warning signs, road barriers or border-guard posts. Do not
            cross into such areas without permission.
            Public transportation

            Use only officially marked taxis and do not share them with strangers. Fares vary
            greatly and vehicles are often poorly maintained.

            Buses and trolleys are poorly maintained and are usually crowded and unheated.

            Exercise caution when travelling by train, especially on sleeper trains to Warsaw and
            Moscow. Store valuables in a safe place and do not leave your compartment unattended.
            Ensure that the door is secured from the inside.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            General safety information

            Ensure that your personal belongings, passports and other travel documents are secure at
            all times.

            Avoid showing signs of affluence and carrying large sums of cash. Always be aware of
            your surroundings.

            Tourist facilities are limited and only available in the larger cities.

            Security authorities may place foreigners under surveillance. Hotel rooms, telephones,
            fax machines and e-mail messages may be monitored. Personal possessions in hotel rooms
            may be searched. Foreigners have been expelled from the country for working with
            Belarusian civil-society groups.
            Emergency services

            Dial 101 to reach fire fighters, 102 for the police and 103 for an ambulance.

            Crime

            Violent crime is uncommon. However, petty crimes (pickpocketing, purse snatching and
            mugging) occur at major transportation hubs and tourist sites. Small groups of criminals
            have been known to target areas near the Grand Place, as well as public transportation,
            airports, and the main railway stations in Brussels and Antwerp. Pickpockets often
            target passengers boarding or disembarking from public transportation. Do not leave
            luggage unattended for even a moment.

            Be particularly cautious when approached by anyone asking odd questions, spilling food
            or drink, or telling you someone else has spilled something on your clothes. Carry only
            a minimal amount of cash and never leave your bags unattended.
            Terrorism

            The Government of Belgium maintains a public alert system on terrorism. On January 15,
            2015, the level was increased from 2 to 3 (on a scale of 1 to 4).] Visit the website of
            the Belgium Federal Interior Ministry\'s crisis centre (in French) for more information.
            Continue to exercise caution and vigilance.
            Transportation

            The train stations Gare du Midi and Gare du Nord in Brussels are major targets for
            organized gangs. Pickpockets operate on international train lines, such as
            Paris-Brussels-Amsterdam and Brussels-London.

            Organized gangs target people travelling by train or by subway after office hours.

            Ensure that valuables in vehicles are kept out of sight at all times. Thieves, often on
            motorbikes, have been known to break a car window while the car is stopped at a traffic
            light and snatch valuables from the front or back seat. Carjackings occur in Brussels
            and the Brabant area.

            Always be suspicious if someone offers to help you with a flat tire. These individuals
            may have punctured the tire themselves and seize the opportunity to steal a bag or other
            valuable objects while you are distracted.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            Demonstrations

            As the capital of the European Union and location of the North Atlantic Treaty
            Organization headquarters, Brussels frequently experiences large-scale protests and
            widespread demonstrations by various interest groups. Avoid all demonstrations and large
            gatherings as they have the potential to suddenly turn violent, follow the advice of
            local authorities and monitor local media.
            General safety measures

            Exercise normal safety precautions. Ensure personal belongings, passports and other
            travel documents are secure at all times, especially on public transportation.
            Emergency services

            Dial the toll free number 112 (also valid for mobiles).

            Crime

            Criminal activity, including armed robbery, mugging and sexual assault, is a significant
            problem throughout Belize. Robberies and assaults have been reported in resort areas.
            There has been a noted increase in violent crime targeting tourists since the end of
            2013. Criminals often operate in groups and target persons travelling alone. Always
            travel in groups and ensure that personal belongings and travel documents are secure at
            all times. Do not show signs of affluence. Use taxis after dark instead of walking.

            Armed robberies occasionally occur near the western border with Guatemala, including
            near and around Caracol. You should only travel to these areas during daylight hours. Be
            cautious when visiting Mayan archaeological sites in that region, and do so only with a
            reputable tour guide. Only use official border crossings to enter Guatemala during the
            day.

            Cases of sexual assault against female travellers have been reported. Always travel in
            groups and avoid isolated areas, including unsupervised beaches, especially at night.
            Never leave food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers. Be wary of accepting
            snacks, beverages, gum or cigarettes from new acquaintances, as they may contain drugs
            that could put you at risk of sexual assault.
            Demonstrations

            Demonstrations and large gatherings can occur throughout the country, especially in
            Belize City and Belmopan, and may turn violent. Avoid all demonstrations, follow the
            advice of local authorities and monitor local media.
            Road travel

            Roads are often poorly maintained and lit. Avoid driving after dark, especially on rural
            roads. Traffic accidents occur regularly. Belize has four paved highways: the Western
            Highway from Belize City to Benque Viejo del Carmen and on to the Guatemalan border; the
            Northern Highway from Belize City to Corozal and on to the Mexican border; the
            Hummingbird Highway from Belmopan to Dangriga; and the Southern Highway from Dangriga to
            the resort area of Placencia and on to the southernmost town of Punta Gorda.

            Be careful crossing bridges on the Hummingbird and Southern Highways, since bridges are
            usually only one lane. Most other roads are unpaved; they can be very dusty in the dry
            season, whereas major puddles and mud can be a problem in the rainy season. Bicycles and
            livestock are often traffic hazards, especially in urban areas.

            Service stations are available on the three main highways connecting Belize City with
            Mexico, Guatemala and southern Belize. Always keep your gas tank full when in remote
            areas, as service stations are scarce and they usually close for holidays. There are no
            emergency road services. A few public telephones can be found in larger villages only.
            You should not stop to offer assistance to others whose vehicles appear to have broken
            down.
            Marine travel

            Passenger boats may be unsafe.
            Air travel

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            Public transportation

            Public buses and taxis are often unsafe due to poor vehicle maintenance. You should only
            use registered taxis with green licence plates.
            Trekking

            If you intend to trek:

            a) never trek alone;
            b) always hire an experienced guide and ensure that the trekking company is reputable;
            c) buy travel health insurance that includes helicopter rescue and medical evacuation;
            d) ensure that you are in good physical condition and that you have sufficient supplies,
            notably water, as the climate is extremely hot and humid;
            e) advise a family member or friend of your itinerary;
            f) register with the Consulate of Canada in Belize; and
            g) obtain detailed information on trekking routes before setting out.
            General safety information

            Ensure the recreational activities you choose are covered by your travel insurance, and
            that rental sporting and aquatic equipment is safe and in good condition, especially for
            diving and snorkelling.

            Avoid insect bites when on the southern coast or in the jungles by using repellent or by
            covering up and avoid being stung by jellyfish when snorkelling.
            Emergency services

            Dial 911 for police.

            Northeast Benin

            Be particularly vigilant in regions bordering Nigeria (specifically, the northern
            portion of the Benin-Nigeria border—because of potential incursions by Nigerian
            militants.
            Crime

            Petty crimes such as purse snatching and pickpocketing occur, but are not as common as
            in other West African countries. Muggings and robberies are a significant problem in
            Cotonou,where incidents usually occur near the port, near railways and along the beaches
            near hotels frequented by international visitors. Armed robbery, especially at night,
            has increased in Cotonou and is common in the area bordering Nigeria. Carjackings are on
            the rise throughout the country. Avoid driving and walking after nightfall. Do not show
            signs of affluence and ensure that your personal belongings and travel documents are
            secure, particularly in the Dantokpa market.
            Piracy

            Pirate attacks occur in coastal waters and, in some cases, farther out at sea. Mariners
            should take appropriate precautions. For additional information, consult the Live Piracy
            Report published by the International Maritime Bureau.
            Fraud

            Canadians have been the victims of Internet scams originating in Benin. Scammers will
            offer enticing business or financial opportunities. Be wary of unsolicited emails.
            Ensure that any business opportunity is legitimate before travelling to Benin.

            Other scams involve online friendships or romances. There are many variations, all with
            the intent of scamming money from people abroad; some Canadians have lost thousands of
            dollars and, in some cases, have been arrested as a result of such situation.

            Credit card fraud is also a considerable problem. Limit your use of credit cards
            whenever possible. See our Overseas Fraud page for more information on scams abroad.
            Road travel

            Road conditions range from fair to poor. Be careful of broken-down vehicles and
            potholes, as these often force traffic to switch lanes without warning. There are paved
            roads in Cotonou and along the coast, and one leading north to Niger. Other roads are
            made of hard-packed sand and may become impassable during the rainy seasons. Local
            driving habits, inadequate lighting, motorcycle traffic and overloaded trucks pose
            additional hazards. Avoid overland travel after dark, particularly on the coastal
            highway, in the regions bordering Togo and Nigeria, and on the road linking Cotonou and
            Parakou. In case of an accident resulting in an injury to a resident, take the
            individual directly to the hospital. If witnesses react strongly, go immediately to the
            nearest police station.

            Fuel shortages are frequent in rural areas of northern Benin.
            Public transportation

            Public transportation in Cotonou, including moped taxis, is not reliable.

            Buses can be used for travel within Benin.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            General safety recommendations

            Tourist facilities are available in Cotonou, which is the main port and largest city in
            Benin, but are limited elsewhere.

            Ocean currents are very strong along the coast. Many people drown each year. Exercise
            caution and avoid visiting beaches alone.
            Emergency assistance

            Dial 117 for police, 118 for fire and 21 30 17 69 or 21 30 06 56 for ambulance services.

            Crime

            Theft and purse snatching are frequent in public places, including transportation
            networks and tourist attractions. Ensure that your personal belongings, passports and
            other travel documents are secure at all times.

            Avoid deserted beaches and unpopulated areas, especially after dark, as sexual assaults
            have occurred in the past.
            Spiked food and drinks

            Never leave food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers. Be wary of accepting
            snacks, beverages, gum, or cigarettes from new acquaintances, as they may contain drugs
            that could put you at risk of sexual assault and robbery.
            Road travel

            Road conditions are generally good, but are often narrow and lack shoulders.

            Safe taxi and bus services are widely available. You can also rent motor scooters;
            exercise caution and drive defensively at all times. It is prohibited for non-residents
            to own, rent or drive four-wheeled vehicles.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            Emergency services

            Dial 911 for emergency assistance.

            Crime

            Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching is common. Ensure that personal
            belongings, passports and other travel documents are secure at all times.
            Transportation

            Traffic drives on the left. There are no railroads and few roads. In the mountains,
            sharp curves, limited visibility and narrow roads create dangerous road conditions.
            However, tourists rarely drive in Bhutan. Their visits are arranged through tour
            operators and they must travel in groups with experienced drivers.

            There are two ways to enter Bhutan: by road or by air. By road through Phuentsholing on
            the southwest border with West Bengal, India,and Samdrup Jongkhar on the far east border
            with Assam, India, or by air by Drukair, Bhutan’s national airline. The border with
            China is closed. Flights are subject to disruptions due to weather and technical
            difficulties.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            General safety information

            Tourist facilities are very limited. Persons with physical disabilities may find it
            difficult to travel in Bhutan.
            Emergency services

            Dial 113 to reach police and 112 for an ambulance.

            Demonstrations

            Demonstrations occur regularly throughout Bolivia, often with little notice, and can
            turn violent without warning. Avoid all demonstrations and public gatherings and follow
            the instructions of local authorities.

            Roadblocks are common in Bolivia. Do not cross roadblocks, even if they appear
            unattended, as this may aggravate the situation and lead to physical harm. Instead, you
            should consider taking alternative, safe routes, or returning to where your travel
            started. If you plan to take a road trip, review your travel plans to determine if they
            will be affected by demonstrations or civil unrest, take personal security measures and
            monitor media reports. Given that roadblocks may occur without warning and have stranded
            travelers for several days, you should take extra food, water, and warm clothing.

            All roads in the border areas, especially along the Bolivia–Peru border, and roads
            leading to La Paz’s international airport (located in El Alto) are particularly
            vulnerable to blockades.
            Crime

            You should remain alert to your surroundings at all times, dress down, avoid wearing
            jewellery or carrying large sums of money or credit cards, and keep cameras and
            electronic equipment out of sight. Secure your valuables in a hotel safe. Avoid small
            restaurants away from downtown and tourist areas.

            Petty theft, including pickpocketing, purse snatching, vehicle theft and auto parts
            theft, is common throughout large cities.

            Organized robbery occurs. Typically, members of a group of thieves will distract victims
            by staging a fight, starting a conversation, blocking a sidewalk, or throwing an object
            or liquid on the victims, while others rob them.

            Robbery and assaults occur at tourist destinations. You should be especially careful
            when walking around tourist areas in La Paz, such as Sarganaga Street, the San Francisco
            Church vicinity and the historical Jaen Street, and when hiking in the areas surrounding
            La Paz, such as La Muela del Diablo. When travelling near Rurrenabaque in the Bolivian
            Andes, Los Yungas, and on the Inca trails, remain in large groups and only join tours
            organized by reputable tour operators.

            Express kidnappings by organized gangs have been reported. Tourists are held for ransom,
            often in a car, and are robbed or forced to use their bank cards to withdraw cash. Radio
            taxis hailed on the street have been involved in such incidents. Do not allow anyone
            else in your taxi; they may be accomplices. Special attention should be paid when taking
            a taxi to and from airports. Express kidnappings occur most frequently in major cities
            such as La Paz, Santa Cruz and Cochabamba, and between Copacabana and Desaguadero (on
            the Peruvian border). The Copacabana–Desaguadero route should be avoided after 2 p.m. It
            is recommended to take direct buses from Copacabana to La Paz rather than to transfer
            buses at the Desaguadero border crossing.

            Exercise vigilance in La Paz bus terminals, especially the one near the La Paz cemetery
            and the main bus terminal (located on Peru Avenue in Zona Norte). In Cochabamba, avoid
            Coronilla Hill (adjacent to the main bus terminal); local authorities caution people to
            enter Coronilla Hill at their own risk, as assaults have been reported. Violent crimes
            and armed robberies against foreigners have also been reported in the Santa Cruz
            bus/train terminal.

            Criminals often pose as police officers and then ask to examine the traveller’s
            belongings or ask the traveller to accompany them to a police station. Bogus police
            stations are sometimes set up to scam tourists. Under Bolivian law, you are not obliged
            to follow a police officer unless he or she has a formal written request from a judge
            with your name on it, and any search or seizure must occur at a bona fide police station
            in the presence of the prosecutor.

            Criminals posing as tourists may approach the traveller and offer to share
            transportation (usually a taxi), which proceeds to a remote place where the traveller is
            robbed. In other cases, a criminal posing as a police officer intercepts the traveller
            interacting with an accomplice, who is posing as a tourist and carrying contraband
            material such as drugs. The “police officer” takes the traveller to a bogus police
            station and seizes documents, debit cards and credit cards.

            In the Chapare area between Santa Cruz and Cochabamba and in the Yungas region,
            northeast of La Paz, violence and civil unrest, mainly associated with drug trafficking,
            may cause delays and risks to travellers. In the departments of Santa Cruz, Pando and
            Beni, police presence has intensified due to increases in drug-related crimes. The
            situation is also tense in areas along Bolivia\'s border with Peru.
            Scams

            Canadians visiting Bolivia in order to undergo a surgical procedure have reported
            falling victim to scams by medical companies that insist on retaining passports as
            collateral. Once the procedure has been completed, the company attempts to extort more
            money from the patient before returning their passport. If your passport is inaccessible
            because of such a situation, you may be subject to investigation by Passport Canada and
            may receive limited passport services.

            Consult our page entitled Receiving Medical Care in Other Countries if you are
            contemplating undergoing a medical procedure in Bolivia.

            Tourists travelling to Bolivia have fallen victim to scams in which cocaine is hidden
            inside objects or luggage that they have been asked to bring back by an acquaintance.
            There are reported cases of this scam being perpetrated through dating websites. The new
            Internet acquaintance asks the foreigner to go to Bolivia, on the pretext of picking up
            personal belongings or legal documents on his or her behalf. When police determine that
            the backpack or briefcase allegedly containing the acquaintance’s belongings or
            documents contains cocaine, the foreign citizen is detained at the airport and
            subsequently sent to a Bolivian prison. Drugs can be hidden in ways that are not clear
            to the naked eye, including being dissolved into clothing or fabric. Bolivian drug laws
            feature a zero tolerance policy and do not differentiate between intentional and
            unintentional drug smuggling. Exercise extreme caution when asked to carry objects or
            luggage for other people and do not, under any circumstance, carry luggage for a
            stranger.
            Road travel

            Road conditions in Bolivia are very poor. Although the major population centres of La
            Paz, Santa Cruz, Cochabamba and Sucre are connected by improved highways, less than 5
            percent of all roads in Bolivia are paved.

            For trips outside major cities, especially in mountainous areas, a four-wheel-drive
            vehicle is recommended. Risks include most drivers\' lack of formal training, unlit
            vehicles speeding at night and drunk drivers, including drivers of commercial buses.
            Weather conditions can also make road travel hazardous.

            Roadblocks are a common occurrence throughout Bolivia and can cause significant
            disruptions to transportation, even in remote parts of the country. More information on
            roads to avoid is available from the Bolivian Highway Administration (in Spanish only).

            Local and intercity buses are frequently involved in traffic accidents, especially
            overnight buses. Traffic accidents on the highways occur due to poor road conditions,
            ongoing and poorly marked road construction, uneven roads in some regions of the country
            and reckless driving. Recent accidents involving tourist buses have resulted in injuries
            and fatalities.
            Public transportation

            Public transportation, including buses, trains, shared taxis and mini-buses, is unsafe.
            Use only tour buses from reputable companies for trips. Avoid extensive travel on foot.

            Do not hail taxis on the street and decline transportation from people offering a
            cheaper fare. It is recommended to call known radio taxi companies from a landline or
            from a hotel and make a note of the taxi’s registration and telephone numbers before you
            set off. Radio taxis are identifiable by the telephone number and the name of the taxi
            company on the vehicle’s roof, and those registered with the Mayor’s office should have
            a yellow sticker in one of their windows. This type of taxi should carry no other
            passengers.
            Air travel

            Travel plans may be affected by demonstrations or strikes. Prior to departure, check
            with your airlines to determine if there are delays or changes in flight schedules.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            Emergency services

            Dial 110 for local police, 118 for ambulance services and 119 to reach the fire
            department. Dial (2) 222-5016 to contact the tourist police in La Paz. Some tourist
            police officers do speak English, but service in French is not available.

        <item>
            Crime

            Petty crime can occur. Avoid unpopulated areas or unpatrolled beaches after dark. Check
            with local authorities to find out which beaches are patrolled. Vehicle theft occurs
            frequently.

            Ensure that personal belongings, passports and travel documents are secure at all times.
            Road safety

            Major roads are in good condition, but road signs are rare. Wandering animals are a
            hazard.
            Public transportation

            Public transportation is reliable. As taxis do not have meters, it is recommended that
            you agree on a fare prior to departure.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.

            Mines

            Demining operations are ongoing but unmarked landmines and unexploded ordnance continue
            to pose a risk, particularly in isolated mountainous areas and in the countryside. Keep
            to main roads, stay on paved surfaces, avoid abandoned houses and buildings and travel
            only during daylight hours. War relics and unknown items should not be touched and
            should be reported to local authorities. For more information, please visit Bosnia and
            Herzegovina Mine Action Centre website.
            Crime

            The crime rate is low. Petty crime (such as pickpocketing, purse snatching and snatching
            visible jewellery) is prevalent, however, particularly in large urban centres.
            Foreigners are often targeted.
            Random violence by organized crime to settle disputes occurs in Sarajevo, and includes
            the use of firearms. Foreigners are rarely the target of these acts, but there is a risk
            of being in the wrong place at the wrong time, such as in nightclubs and cafés late at
            night and in the early morning hours.
            Demonstrations

            Occasional demonstrations and strikes addressing various grievances occur in the capital
            and in other cities and might cause traffic disruptions. Demonstrations turned violent
            in Tuzla in the beginning of February 2014 and spread, with varying degrees of violence,
            to Sarajevo, Bihac, Zenica, Mostar, Sanski Most, Brčko and many other locations
            throughout Bosnia and Herzegovina. The violence has since died down and demonstrations
            have been largely peaceful. Further demonstrations may occur, however, and have the
            potential to suddenly turn violent. Social tensions also occasionally result in
            demonstrations. Avoid all demonstrations and large gatherings, follow the advice of
            local authorities and monitor local media.
            Road travel

            Travel by road can be hazardous due to traffic congestion and poorly maintained roads
            and vehicles. Drivers do not follow safe driving practices, and are known to speed and
            drive drunk. Extreme weather conditions—such as dense fog and black ice—also pose risks.
            Bosnia and Herzegovina has a disproportionately high rate of death and injury due to
            motor vehicle accidents. The emergency number for assistance, road conditions and towing
            service is 1282.

            During winter months, many roads are particularly hazardous. Secondary roads and many
            mountain roads may be blocked. During the summer, traffic is frequently stopped to
            enable landmine clearance and road repairs. Visit the Bosnia and Herzegovina auto club
            Bihamk for up-to-date information on road conditions.

            There are only two-lane roads. Many secondary roads have no service stations; undertake
            travel on secondary roads only with a vehicle in excellent mechanical condition and with
            sufficient fuel, food and water supplies.
            Public transportation

            Local rail, tram and bus services are reliable but sometimes slow. Inter-city bus
            service is widely available and a few train lines operate, although train service is
            slow and the schedule is often unreliable. Lock compartment doors from the inside when
            travelling on an overnight train.

            Taxi service is available in most towns and for inter-city travel. Use only registered
            taxis whose licence plates begin with “TA”. Ensure that the meter is running. Pay
            particular attention at the airport.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            General safety information

            Ensure that your personal belongings, passports and other travel documents are secure at
            all times. Avoid isolated and poorly lit areas after dark. Avoid showing signs of
            affluence and carrying large sums of cash.

            While tourist facilities and services have improved, they may be limited outside major
            cities.

            Dial 112 for emergency assistance.

        <item>
            Crime

            Pickpocketing, thefts and “smash and grab” robberies are on the rise in the country. You
            should not show signs of affluence and should remain aware of your surroundings. Avoid
            walking alone after dark, particularly in urban and peri-urban areas.

            Carry a photocopy of your passport with you at all times, and keep your original
            document in safekeeping facilities. It is also advisable to leave a photocopy of your
            travel documents with a relative or a friend at home.
            Demonstrations

            Demonstrations occur and have the potential to suddenly turn violent. They can lead to
            significant disruptions to traffic and public transportation. Avoid all demonstrations
            and large gatherings, follow the advice of local authorities and monitor local media.
            Wild animals

            Wild animals can pose risks. Observe all local or park regulations and instructions
            given by tour guides. Wildlife areas are not fenced and warning signs are few. Do not
            swim in rivers or lakes as wildlife attacks are possible, particularly from crocodiles
            and hippopotamus. Do not walk alone or unescorted after dark because of the threat from
            nocturnal predators, particularly lion, hyena or leopard.
            Road travel

            Road conditions are generally good in major towns, but overland travel outside major
            centres can be dangerous. Driving standards, high speed limits, long stretches of
            highway and poor lighting pose hazards, particularly at night. A reliable private
            roadside assistance service called Medical Rescue International is available by calling
            390-1601.

            Failure to obey traffic signs, driving while intoxicated or not being in possession of a
            valid driver’s licence may result in arrest and heavy fines.

            Pedestrians and roaming livestock or wild animals may pose a hazard on rural roadways,
            particularly in the Okavango, Chobe, Savuti, Pandamatenga and Ghanzi districts.

            Desert conditions and conditions in remote areas are harsh. Travel to these areas should
            not be undertaken without a guide if possible nor without serious planning in advance,
            and a four-wheel-drive vehicle well equipped with provisions, fuel and water.

            When you travel by road, for example, if you have hired an Avis 4 x 4 vehicle, you will
            be entirely responsible for your safety as there are generally no guides provided then
            or when you enter the parks. You should ensure that friends or relatives are aware of
            your travel itinerary so that they can keep in contact with you. Guides are provided by
            private camps or mobile safaris when you fly directly into the Delta or similar
            conservancy areas, as they are part of the commercial or guided safari packages. This is
            not necessarily the case with self-drive travel.

            Some hotels operate a minibus service between the airport and Gaborone. You should
            verify whether your hotel provides this service and reserve the transfer in advance.
            Vehicles can be rented at the airport in Gaborone. In major towns, taxis are generally
            safe, but the fare should be determined before departure.
            Public transportation

            Domestic air services are available.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.

            Passenger train service in Botswana has been discontinued. There are reliable buses for
            long distance journeys to Johannesburg, Lusaka, Harare, which can be found at the main
            Bus Rank in Gaborone. Mini buses leave at hourly intervals to Johannesburg from the main
            Bus Rank in Gaborone. Long distance buses normally leave in the early hours, around 6
            a.m. For reliable transportation to Johannesburg from Gaborone, you must book at least
            one day before the travel date. Reliable operators used for the

            Gang-related violence

            Police efforts to crack down on crime in favelas (shanty towns) have led to retaliation
            by criminal gangs. As a result, there is an increased chance of violence everywhere,
            including major thoroughfares. Remain vigilant at all times and comply with security
            directives imposed by local authorities.

            Incidents of gang-related violence continue to pose a threat in large urban centres,
            where there is often a visible disparity in the levels of wealth. In the past, targets
            have included police stations, buses, official buildings and businesses. Most tourist
            hubs and destinations have also been targeted. In urban centres, particularly in or near
            favelas, violent incidents and armed clashes between police forces and alleged criminals
            are a regular occurrence. Although additional security forces have been deployed
            throughout the country, future incidents are likely and could involve the use of
            firearms, as these are increasingly easy to obtain.

            Exercise a high degree of caution at all times and avoid travelling alone, especially at
            night.
            Crime

            Serious crime, which can involve significant violence, is high in most urban centres,
            including, but not limited to, Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, Brasilia, Recife and Salvador.
            The use of firearms is common. Victims have been seriously injured or killed when
            resisting perpetrators.

            Robberies involving tourists occur regularly, even during the day, and are sometimes
            violent. Avoid isolated areas and unsupervised beaches with poor visibility from the
            sidewalk, and ensure that your hotel or living accommodation is totally secure. Mass mob
            or flash mob robberies (arrastões) have occurred on city beaches and other crowded
            areas. This crime involves a large group of thieves that swarm an area and snatch
            valuable items such as cash, jewellery and cell phones. You should be extremely
            vigilant. Incidents of sexual assault against foreigners have been reported, sometimes
            involving the use of sedatives. Unaccompanied female travellers should exercise caution
            in dealing with strangers or recent acquaintances, and be extremely cautious about
            accepting invitations.

            Visits to favelas (shantytowns) are not recommended; however, those who choose to visit
            should only go in the company of a reputable tour guide and must exercise extreme
            caution. Crime levels in favelas are extremely high and police assistance in these areas
            is very limited. There have been incidents of injuries and deaths as a result of stray
            bullets near and in favelas.

            Street crime, including pickpocketing, mugging and purse snatching, is common,
            especially during public festivities such as the annual Carnival. Tourists are a
            favourite target. Be vigilant when visiting outdoor markets and be cautious of
            strategies to distract your attention. Avoid walking alone on beaches or in central
            areas of major cities after dark, and use well-lit and well-frequented streets. Carry
            only small amounts of money and avoid showing signs of affluence, including jewelry,
            watches and portable electronic devices (laptops, ipads etc.) Store your valuables and
            important documents in a hotel safe. As Brazilian authorities require all individuals to
            carry some form of identification, carry a photocopy of the identification page of your
            passport and visa documentation.

            Express kidnappings and carjackings occur throughout the country, particularly in larger
            cities. Victims are usually picked up from the street and forced to withdraw funds from
            automated banking machines (ABMs). Remain cautious with new acquaintances who offer
            friendship, hospitality or assistance. Use only ABMs in well-lit public areas or inside
            banks and avoid using them during the evening and at night. Credit card fraud is also
            common, and travellers are advised to keep their cards in sight when executing a
            transaction.

            Armed robberies at restaurants is a growing issue. Patrons should exercise caution and
            be aware of their surroundings. In all cases, comply with the attackers orders to
            mitigate the chances of violence.

            Criminal activity may occur in Brazilian coastal waters. Mariners are advised to take
            appropriate precautions and ensure that they can communicate with authorities easily in
            case of emergency.
            Demonstrations and civil unrest

            Demonstrations and political and labour strikes are common and could lead to violent
            incidents. Roadblocks are sometimes used during protests.

            Since June 10, 2013, demonstrations have been taking place throughout Brazil to protest
            against corruption and an increase in costs to basic services. Monitor local media and
            developments, follow the advice of local authorities and avoid all large crowds, as even
            peaceful demonstrations can turn violent suddenly.

            In São Paulo, protests can cause delays along the main road to Guarulhos International
            Airport. Expect traffic and public transportation disruptions.
            Road travel

            Brazil has one of the highest road accident rates in the world. Driving is hazardous due
            to aggressive driving habits, a significant number of trucks, reckless passing,
            excessive speeds, poorly marked lanes, construction, vehicles moving in the wrong
            direction on one-way streets, and poorly maintained roads. Avoid driving after dark, and
            keep car doors locked and windows closed at all times. Be careful when stopping on the
            side of any highway, both for traffic and for the potential of being a victim of crime.

            When driving in the city, pay particular attention to your surroundings while waiting at
            traffic lights. It is common for motorists to treat red lights as stop signs between the
            hours of 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. to protect against hold-ups at intersections. Most cities
            will have a flashing yellow light to indicate that drivers only need to yield.
            Pedestrians and motorists proceeding through green lights during these hours should be
            particularly cautious. If you feel threatened at any time, do not stop.
            Air travel

            Reconfirm flight details with your airline and arrive at the airport two hours prior to
            departure for international flights and one hour prior to departure for domestic
            flights. Failure to do so could result in the loss of your seat, as airlines attempt to
            accommodate passengers on waiting lists. Boarding gates frequently change before the
            final boarding announcement. Boarding announcements are often given in Portuguese only.
            Verify with airport personnel and listen carefully to all announcements, to ensure that
            you are at the proper boarding gate.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            Public transportation

            Theft on buses and trams is common, especially at night. Violent incidents are
            frequently perpetrated in unofficial taxis, which are often present at airports.
            Registered taxis are clearly identified but may look different in each city. To be safe,
            purchase tickets from taxi offices in the airport arrival hall. In town, use taxis from
            taxi stands. Only use official taxis to travel to and from airports. Few taxi drivers
            speak English or French. Local law requires the use of the taxi meter to determine the
            legal fare; adding surcharges to a fare is illegal. Should taxi rates change, drivers
            may indicate these changes by showing an authorised paper with the new fares if their
            meters have not been adjusted. At night, it is safer to order a taxi by telephone.
            Emergency services

            Report all criminal incidents to the nearest police station.

            Dial 193 for the fire department, 190 for the police and 192 for ambulance services.

            In São Paulo, dial (11) 3120-4447 or 3151-4167 to reach the tourist police (Delegacia de
            Proteção ao Turista). In Rio de Janeiro, dial (21) 2332-2924, 2332-2511 or 2332-5112 to
            reach the tourist police.

            In case of emergency or an accident with injuries, dial 193 throughout the country. In
            the event of an accident without injuries, contact the military police at 190. Never
            confront the driver of the other vehicle in an accident, as this should be handled by
            the police. Roadside assistance is generally offered by local garage owners.
            General safety information

            Undertake travel in the Amazon border regions and the Pantanal wetlands only with
            trained guides. These areas are largely uninhabited and dangerous.

            Exercise caution when swimming offshore. Strong currents and sharks are present,
            especially in Recife. Follow the advice of local authorities before swimming.

            Large scale events such as Carnival celebrations, sporting events and international
            conferences are a common occurrence in larger cities such as Rio de Janeiro and
            Salvador. Remain vigilant during such events as fraud and theft become more frequent.
            Banks and businesses are commonly closed during these occasions.

            Crime

            The crime rate is very low, but petty crime occurs. Avoid unpopulated areas and
            unpatrolled beaches. Local authorities can help you determine which beaches are safest.
            Avoid deserted beaches and poorly lit, isolated areas after dark. Exercise normal
            precautions and ensure that your personal belongings, passports and other travel
            documents are secure at all times.
            Spiked food and drinks

            Never leave food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers. Be wary of accepting
            snacks, beverages, gum, or cigarettes from new acquaintances, as they may contain drugs
            that could put you at risk of sexual assault and robbery.
            Road travel

            Road conditions are generally good, but exercise extra caution on steep and narrow
            mountain roads. Excessive speed and reckless driving may pose risks. Roadside assistance
            is not widely available.
            Public transportation

            Public transportation is available, but service is unpredictable. Taxi service is
            reliable; confirm the fare before departure. Rental cars are also available.

            Reliable ferry services are offered between Tortola and its sister islands of Virgin
            Gorda and Jost Van Dyke, as well as to the U.S. Virgin Islands. Crewed yachts and
            sailboats are also available.

            Crime

            Petty crime, such as break-ins and theft, occurs. Violent crime is rare. Ensure that
            your personal belongings and passports and other travel documents are secure at all
            times.
            Transportation

            Traffic drives on the left. Running of red lights and speeding are common infractions.
            Drivers should remain at the scene of an accident and not move their vehicles until
            police arrive.

            Buses and taxis may be available. Buses run infrequently and are not available at night.
            Taxis are located at major hotels but not otherwise readily available.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            Trekking

            Visitors to rainforests should always be accompanied by an experienced guide.

            Crime

            Petty crime is less widespread in Sofia than in most Western European cities.
            Nevertheless, petty crimes (such as pickpocketing, mugging and purse snatching) do
            occur, particularly at railway and bus stations, tourist sites and crowded areas. Be
            especially vigilant at tourist resorts along the Black Sea.

            Vehicle theft occurs. Park in a guarded location, and always keep valuable belongings
            out of sight.
            Organized crime

            Organized criminal groups are active in casinos and nightclubs and are involved in
            prostitution. Although rare, violent crime, which includes bombings and shootouts
            generally attributed to turf wars between rival gangs, occurs.
            Demonstrations

            Demonstrations occur and have the potential to suddenly turn violent. They can lead to
            significant disruptions to traffic and public transportation. Avoid all demonstrations
            and large gatherings, follow the advice of local authorities and monitor local media.
            Road travel

            Driving can be hazardous due to aggressive drivers, high speeds, poor road conditions
            outside major centres and a lack of traffic signs and lane markings. Do not drive after
            dark and be very cautious in winter. Animals are commonly found on rural roads, posing a
            risk. Confronting aggressive drivers is not recommended, as they may be armed.

            Be cautious when crossing streets, as drivers do not always give pedestrians the right
            of way.

            Police have been known to solicit bribes. While you may be delayed if you refuse to pay
            the bribe, there have been few reports of problems beyond inconvenience.
            Public transportation

            Use only licensed taxis with meters. Verify the tariffs on the taxi’s window before
            entering it. At Sofia Airport, visit the taxis booth within the arrivals terminal to
            obtain a fair rate.

            Rail services are generally poor by Western standards. It is preferable, therefore, to
            travel by inter-city buses, which are frequent, comfortable and relatively fast.

            Most cities and larger towns have public transportation systems. There are regular bus
            services between most major towns in the country.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            Spiked food and drinks

            Never leave food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers. Be wary of accepting
            snacks, beverages, gum or cigarettes from new acquaintances, as the items may contain
            drugs that could put you at risk of sexual assault and robbery.
            General safety information

            Carry adequate identification at all times. Keep a photocopy of your passport in case of
            loss or seizure.

            Exercise a high degree of caution. Ensure that your personal belongings and passport and
            other travel documents are secure at all times. Valuables and important documents should
            be stored in a hotel safe. Avoid showing signs of affluence and carrying large sums of
            cash.

            Area north of the Djibo-Dori line (see advisory)

            A European citizen was abducted by an armed group on April 4, 2015, in the Tambao region
            (near Gorom-Gorom). There have also been kidnappings of Westerners in neighbouring
            countries. The threat of kidnapping persists in this region, due to the proximity of the
            Mali and Niger borders. Caution should be exercised at all times. Should you plan to go
            to these areas despite the risk, use varied and unpredictable routes and itineraries
            when moving from one place to the other. If possible, use an armed security escort for
            all travel within this region.
            Border regions

            Be particularly cautious in border areas, owing to the threat of banditry and
            kidnapping.
            Banditry

            Incidents of carjacking are frequently reported and can occur anywhere in the country.
            Illegal roadblocks are routinely set up by armed bandits “coupeurs de routes”, who do
            not hesitate to shoot to stop and rob vehicles. The main areas affected are the eastern,
            central, east-central and north-central regions, and the central plateau. However, such
            incidents can also happen in other areas, day or night, on both main and secondary
            roads. Exercise caution at all times, and, if possible, travel in a convoy and avoid
            travel in the early hours of the morning and after sundown. In the event that you are
            attacked, you should not offer any resistance and should contact the local authorities
            as soon as possible (Gendarmerie – numéro vert 10 10).
            Increased threat of attacks and kidnappings

            In 2013, the French military assisted the Malian government in efforts to repel armed
            rebels. Terrorist groups in the region declared their intention to increase attacks and
            kidnappings targeting Westerners. While the United Nations peacekeeping mission in Mali
            has been supporting the transitional authorities in stabilizing the region since July
            2013, citizens of countries supporting the intervention are still at particular risk,
            but all travellers should exercise increased vigilance in the region.
            Crime

            Purse snatching, muggings and theft from hotel rooms occur in major cities. In
            Ougadougou, the areas around the United Nations circle and the Central Market are often
            targeted by thieves. Ensure personal belongings, passport and other travel documents are
            secure at all times. Always carry a legally certified photocopy of your passport\'s
            identification page. Avoid showing signs of affluence and walking alone after dark.
            Petty crime occurs to a lesser degree elsewhere in the country.
            Transportation

            Driving in Burkina Faso can be hazardous. Roads are generally narrow, unpaved and full
            of potholes. There are few streetlights. Pedestrians, bicycles, carts and vehicles
            without headlights pose serious hazards. Many trucks transit the country at night.
            Travel after dark is not recommended.

            Public transportation is not safe.

            The only train line is between Ouagadougou and Bobo Dioulasso. Trains run daily and are
            very crowded.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.

            Water Festival (Thingyan) and New Year

            Burma’s Water Festival (Thingyan) and New Year take place April 12, 2015 to April 21,
            2015. In previous years, the incidence of violent and petty crime, including drinking
            and driving, increased during the festival. Exercise a high degree of caution and be
            mindful of the increased risk of road and pedestrian accidents, overcrowded vehicles and
            large unruly crowds celebrating on the streets.

            Shops, restaurants, banks and government offices close for Thingyan. Official and
            unofficial road closures will occur in Yangon and other regional centres and may affect
            journeys to and from airports as well as bus/train stations during this period. Take
            these factors into account when planning your travel.
            Political situation

            The political situation is volatile and there is always a possibility of civil unrest.
            You may find your security unexpectedly at risk. Acts of politically motivated violence
            may occur at any time, including in areas frequented by tourists and expatriates such as
            shopping centres, supermarkets, restaurants, markets, hotels, transportation hubs, and
            public transit (even taxis). Exercise a high degree of caution, avoid concentrations of
            police and security forces, avoid gatherings and remain informed of current issues.
            Inter-communal violence

            Inter-communal violence occurs. More than 200 people have been killed in religious
            violence since June 2012, and more than 140,000 have been displaced (mostly in Rakhine
            State). Attacks against religious buildings, shops, and homes have taken place in
            several areas, including the regions of Bago and Mandalay, resulting in injuries, deaths
            and displaced persons. Tensions remain high, and further violence is possible. Curfews
            and restrictions may be imposed or changed on short notice.

            Incidents of violence, which resulted in injuries and damage to property, occurred in
            Mandalay in early July 2014. In late March 2014, violent protests targeting the staff
            and offices of international organizations took place in Sittwe, Rakhine State.
            Crime

            Bomb explosions have occurred throughout the country, including in major cities such as
            Yangon (Rangoon), Mandalay, and Nay Pyi Taw. Further attacks could occur at any time.

            There have been incidents of violent crime against foreigners. There is also a risk of
            street crime, such as pickpocketing and mugging. Ensure that your personal belongings,
            passports and other travel documents are secure at all times.
            Transportation

            Travel is restricted outside major cities to designated tourist areas only. Permission
            from local authorities is required to visit certain areas. Military checkpoints on roads
            are common.

            The general condition of automobiles does not meet minimal international standards.
            There is a combination of both left-hand and right-hand drive vehicles in use throughout
            the country. Driving can be hazardous, especially after dark. Some roads can become
            impassable, particularly during the rainy season. Drivers have little regard for traffic
            regulations and do not follow safe-driving practices. It is common for pedestrians and
            livestock to walk on roads. A driver involved in any accident with a pedestrian is
            always at fault and is liable to be detained.

            Public transportation within Burma, including air, rail and sea travel, often does not
            meet international safety standards. Railway equipment tends to be outdated, and fatal
            accidents have occurred. Boat and ferry accidents causing deaths are common. Vessels may
            be in poor condition and overloading is a common problem.

            Local flight schedules can change without notice.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            General safety information

            Tourist facilities are adequate in Bagan, Inle Lake, Mandalay, Ngapali Beach, Yangon and
            Taunggyi, but limited elsewhere. Good hotel facilities exist in Naypyidaw, but
            transportation is limited. Foreign tourists rarely visit Naypyidaw and may be viewed
            with suspicion. Foreigners can expect to pay several times more than locals for
            accommodations, domestic flights and entry to tourist sites throughout the country.

            Telephone services are unreliable in Yangon and are difficult to find in other areas.
            Long-distance calls can be extremely expensive. There are Internet cafés in Yangon;
            identification is required, access to certain websites is restricted and records of
            which websites users have visited are kept. While some websites were unblocked in 2011,
            many remain inaccessible. Electronic communications, including email, may be monitored
            by local authorities.

            The presence of police and security forces is likely to increase in Yangon and elsewhere
            in Burma on significant dates, including the anniversary of demonstrations led by monks
            to protest for political reform (September 26) and the anniversary of the 1988 uprising
            (August 8).

            Landmines are a danger, particularly in border areas.
            Swimming

            Exercise caution at beach resorts in Ngwesaung, Chaungtha and Ngapali as there are
            strong underwater currents and riptides. There are no lifeguards and drownings have
            occurred.
            Scuba diving

            Exercise caution when considering diving excursions in Burma. Rented diving equipment
            may not meet internationally acceptable safety standards and may not be maintained
            adequately.
            Trekking

            Tourists trekking in remote parts of the country have experienced difficulties with
            military authorities, even after obtaining prior permission.

            Provinces of Bubanza and Cibitoke (see Advisory)

            Border security is still a concern in these provinces, given the various violent clashes
            in eastern DRC and occasional cross-border movement by armed groups. Banditry, small
            arms trafficking, kidnappings and attacks on civilians by former soldiers, rebels and
            youth gangs have been reported.
            Bujumbura

            Exercise a high degree of caution in Bujumbura. There is a risk of low-level political
            violence in Kanyosha, Kinindo, Musaga, Kinama, Kamenge and the area near the Kibira
            forest. Grenade attacks and exchange of gun fire have occurred. High crime rates are
            also a concern.
            Terrorism

            Regional terror groups, including those associated with al Qaeda and al-Shabaab,
            continue to threaten Western interests and other potential targets in Burundi. The
            September 21, 2013 attack on an upscale Nairobi mall illustrates the threat of attacks
            on civilians in East Africa. Further attacks cannot be ruled out. Be vigilant in crowded
            places and monitor local media.
            Crime

            Crime rates are high, and significantly increase after dark. Incidents of muggings at
            gun or knife point, armed car hijackings, robbery, purse snatching and pickpocketing
            occur. Crime is often committed by children. Assaults occur against people walking or
            jogging alone, particularly on roads around Lake Tanganyika. Avoid walking, driving or
            taking public transportation after dark, anywhere in the country. There are large
            amounts of small arms and weapons in circulation, easily available to various groups.
            Keep valuables, travel documents, and cash in hotel safes. Keep separate copies of
            important documents, including your passport.
            Demonstrations

            Demonstrations occur and have the potential to suddenly turn violent. They can lead to
            significant disruptions to traffic and public transportation. Avoid all demonstrations
            and large gatherings, follow the advice of local authorities and monitor local media.
            Road travel

            Road conditions have greatly improved throughout the country over the last decade, yet
            there is still a need for strict adherence to security rules and procedures. Information
            on road security must be checked on a daily basis. You can seek advice from the UN
            office in Burundi (tel: + 257 22205598).

            There are few traffic signals and signs. Roads are not marked and street lights are
            almost non-existent, which makes driving at night especially dangerous. You should carry
            multiple spare tires. During the rainy season, many roads are only accessible with
            four-wheel-drive vehicles. Driving habits are often more erratic and reckless than in
            Canada.

            Service stations are rare and roadside assistance is not available outside the capital.
            In the event of an accident, leave the scene without stopping and go to the nearest
            police station or, if necessary, to the hospital.It is recommended that road travel be
            undertaken in a convoy of at least two vehicles. Overland travel outside of Bujumbura
            should be avoided. You may encounter legitimate roadblocks. However, be aware that
            criminals are known to impersonate security forces and setup fake roadblocks to solicit
            bribes. Periodic closure of the border between Burundi and the Democratic Republic of
            Congo can occur without notice.
            Public transportation

            The use of public transportation, particularly taxis, is discouraged, as drivers often
            operate within a criminal network. If the use of a taxi is unavoidable, a recommended
            taxi should be identified. Public buses (matatus) should not be used, as vehicle and
            road conditions are the cause of frequent serious accidents.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            General security information

            Exercise extreme caution, monitor local media reports and maintain close contact with
            the Consulate of Canada in Bujumbura or the High Commission of Canada in Nairobi, Kenya.

            Tourist facilities are very limited. You should select local accommodation and
            transportation wisely. Local tour operators, including those offering adventure
            activities, may not offer safety standards and equipment that correspond to those found
            in Canada. Telecommunications are poor.

            Swimming in lakes and rivers is unsafe because of the possibility of being attacked by
            wildlife and the risk of catching water-borne diseases. Check with local authorities for
            the latest information.

            There is no ambulance service.

            Crime

            Violent crime has increased. Petty crime such as pick-pocketing and purse snatching is
            common, especially in crowded outdoor market areas and particularly in the city of
            Mindelo, on the island of São Vicente, and in Praia, on the island of São Tiago.
            Road travel

            The road system is extensive, particularly on the island of São Tiago. Main roads are
            usually paved with cobblestones but can be narrow, winding, and poorly lit. Most other
            roads are unpaved. Drivers and pedestrians should exercise caution, particularly after
            dark. Organized roadside assistance is not widely available. An ambulance service
            operates in São Tiago, São Vicente, Sal, Fogo Island, and Ribeira Grande on Santo Antão.
            Public transportation

            Intercity van service can be hazardous due to the bad driving habits of local residents.
            Taxis hailed from hotels are generally reliable. Car rentals are available on the
            islands of São Tiago and São Vicente. You should purchase sufficient car insurance. In
            Praia, city buses and taxis are reliable, clean and in good condition.

            Domestic flights are available through TACV, the national air carrier. Delays or sudden
            cancellations can occur due to violent winds or sandstorms.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.

            A ferry service operates between Praia and the islands of Brava and Fogo, and between
            São Vicente and Santo Antão. Delays and frequent schedule changes occur. Boats may have
            limited space for luggage.

            Sea conditions can be treacherous. Mariners should seek local advice prior to travel,
            particularly to the islands of Fogo and Brava. You should advise local ports of arrival
            and departure times and provide relatives with your itinerary.
            General safety information

            Do not show signs of affluence and ensure personal belongings, passports, and other
            travel documents are secure at all times.

            You should travel in groups, particularly after dark. Tourist facilities are limited.

            Strong currents and powerful waves make swimming and water sports dangerous at some
            locations. You should be vigilant on beaches and never swim alone.
        </item>
        <item>
            Preah Vihear temple area and surrounding border region (see Advisory)

            There have been a series of clashes between Cambodia and Thailand over a border dispute
            in this region, including exchanges of gunfire and artillery that resulted in numerous
            fatalities and the evacuation of civilians. The presence of landmines has been reported.
            The situation could deteriorate without warning. Exercise a high level of caution if
            travelling to any area along the Cambodian-Thai border.
            Crime

            Street crime targeting foreigners, including pick-pocketing, is common in urban areas,
            including Phnom Penh, Siem Reap and Sihanoukville, even during daylight hours. Armed
            assaults also occur, especially along the riverfront in Phnom Penh and on isolated
            beaches in Sihanoukville. Canadians have been injured in the course of assaults and
            armed robberies. Thieves, sometimes on motorcycles, grab bags and other valuables
            (including passports) from pedestrians, motorcycle drivers and motorcycle passengers.
            Personal belongings have been stolen from locked rooms, particularly in low-cost
            accommodations. Items have been removed from luggage stored in the luggage compartments
            of buses, especially on the journey between Phnom Penh and Siem Reap.

            Banditry continues, largely at night, in rural areas and on routes between Snoul, Kratie
            and Stung Treng in the northeastern provinces. Foreigners have encountered difficulties
            with ill-disciplined police and military personnel. Exercise a high degree of caution at
            all times, avoid travelling alone, especially at night, and ensure personal belongings
            and passports and other travel documents are secure at all times. Firearm ownership is
            high, and guns are often used in cases of robbery and personal dispute or disagreement,
            including those involving foreigners.
            Women’s safety

            Sexual assaults have been reported. Consult our publication entitled Her own way - a
            woman’s safe-travel guide for travel safety information for Canadian women.
            Scams

            Scams targeting tourists occur. Card games are often involved. Some travellers have been
            taken to an automated banking machine and forced to withdraw money.

            Travellers have been the victim of scams and extortion at border crossings. Some have
            reported that border officials demanded they pay extra charges before allowing entry
            into Cambodia. In other cases, travellers were taken by strangers to isolated areas for
            extended periods of time and were intimidated and pressed for payment. Carefully
            consider accepting assistance from individuals offering to help with documentation or
            transportation.
            Demonstrations

            Political and labour protests took place frequently from July 2013 to January 2014, and
            violent clashes during these demonstrations resulted in deaths and injuries. Although an
            agreement was reached between the ruling and opposition parties in July 2014, protests
            relating to ongoing labour disputes may still occur and have the potential to suddenly
            turn violent. Avoid large gatherings and demonstrations, monitor local media and follow
            the advice of local authorities.
            Terrorism

            In recent years, Cambodian authorities have averted a number of attempted bomb plots. On
            September 13, 2013, explosive devices were found in Phnom Penh, near the National
            Assembly Building and near Freedom Park.
            Transportation

            Extremely poor road conditions, local disregard for traffic laws and drunk drivers
            result in frequent accidents. Travel by road should be undertaken in daylight hours, by
            either scheduled bus or cars travelling in convoy. Boats are often overcrowded, lack
            adequate safety equipment and are susceptible to robbery by armed gangs. Boat owners
            accept no liability for accidents. Avoid travelling by train due to poor track
            maintenance.

            With the exception of flights between Phnom Penh and Siem Reap, internal air service can
            be unpredictable, and flights may be cancelled on short notice.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.

            Travel from Laos should be undertaken by air only. The Laotian side of the border is
            often closed to international travellers. For travel to Laos from Cambodia, you must
            obtain the relevant visa prior to arrival at the border.
            Travel by motorcycle

            Motorcycles are a common means of transportation in urban areas. Motorcycle accidents
            kill or maim several Canadians each year. Driving or riding on motorcycles in Cambodia
            is dangerous and should be avoided, even by experienced motorcyclists.

            Passports are often requested as a guarantee when renting motorcycles. Unscrupulous
            owners have followed renters and taken the motorcycle by removing the lock and chain
            when the vehicle was parked, leaving the traveller without a motorcycle or passport. You
            should purchase your own locks and chains.

            Canadian passports may not be used as collateral (as assurance for debts, rental of
            motorcycles, etc.). If your passport is inaccessible or stolen as a result of such
            misuse, you may be subject to investigation by Passport Canada and may receive limited
            passport services.
            General safety information

            Tourist facilities are well developed in Phnom Penh, Siem Reap and Sihanoukville, but
            limited elsewhere.

            Canadians are encouraged to register with the Embassy of Australia in Phnom Penh in
            order to receive the latest information on situations and events that could affect your
            safety.
            Landmines

            Cambodia remains one of the most heavily mined countries in the world. Landmines can be
            found in rural areas, especially in the provinces of Banteay Meanchey, Siem Reap (except
            in the town of Siem Reap and the Angkor temples, which are safe), Battambang, Kampong
            Thom and Pursat. The border area with Thailand is especially dangerous. Do not walk in
            forested areas or in dry rice paddies without a local guide. Areas around small bridges
            or secondary roads are dangerous. Do not visit outlying temples, particularly in the
            areas of Phnom Kulen and the River of a Thousand Lingas, as they are heavily mined.
            Strictly observe warning signs and do not handle any unknown object.
            Drugs

            Illicit drug use has led to the death of several Canadians in Cambodia. For more
            information on how to avoid difficult and dangerous situations related to illegal drugs,
            consult Alcohol, Drugs and Travel.
            Piracy

            Pirate attacks occur in coastal waters and, in some cases, farther out at sea. Mariners
            should take appropriate precautions. For additional information, consult the Live Piracy
            Report published by the International Maritime Bureau.

            The Far North region (see Advisory)

            The growing presence of extremist groups has resulted in an increase of kidnappings and
            banditry in this region. The most recent kidnapping, involving a Canadian and two
            Italians, took place on April 5, 2014.
            The areas bordering Nigeria, Chad and the Central African Republic (see Advisory)

            A state of emergency is in effect in the Nigerian states of Borno and Adamawa, which
            border northwest Cameroon. Instability in these provinces could spill over into
            Cameroon.

            Carjacking, assaults, kidnappings and other forms of armed banditry occur in these
            areas. Security risks have increased along the border with Nigeria as a result of the
            situation in Mali, which has prompted terrorist groups in the region to declare their
            intention to increase attacks and kidnappings targeting Westerners.
            The Bakassi Peninsula (see Advisory)

            Various forms of banditry have been reported in this area due to its isolated location.
            The risk of social tensions may increase as the end of the Green Tree Agreement
            approaches (August 2013).
            Ebola

            The air, land and maritime borders with Nigeria are closed, due to the Ebola outbreak.
            Flights originating from affected countries have been suspended until further notice.
            Confirm the status of your flight with the airline before heading to the airport.
            Crime

            Violent assault and robbery are on the rise in the Melong area, especially against
            foreign tourists. Hiking around the region is strongly discouraged. Avoid staying at the
            hotels in the Mount Manengouba and Twin Lakes areas.

            Violent crime is on the rise, particularly in Yaoundé and Douala. Armed burglaries and
            attacks are common in urban centres, in tourist areas in the north, and on rural
            highways. Do not resist robberies as perpetrators may use violence. Violent assaults on
            taxi passengers can occur.

            Petty theft is prevalent and occurs on trains, buses and taxis. The Hilton and Mont Fébé
            hotels offer a shuttle service from Nsimalen Airport to downtown Yaoundé. You should use
            this service or arrange to be met, especially after dark. Avoid isolated and poorer
            areas of Yaoundé, in particular la Briquetterie, Mokolo, and Mvog-Ada. Avoid travelling
            alone or after dark. Do not show signs of affluence.
            Fraud

            Cases of attempted fraud are frequently reported in Cameroon. See our Overseas Fraud
            page for more information on scams abroad.
            Demonstrations

            You should avoid large crowds and political demonstrations, and exercise caution at all
            times. Contact the High Commission of Canada in Yaoundé for the latest security
            information.
            Piracy

            Pirate attacks occur in coastal waters and, in some cases, farther out at sea. Mariners
            should take appropriate precautions. For additional information, consult the Live Piracy
            Report published by the International Maritime Bureau.
            Transportation

            Major roads are in good condition but others are damaged and unsafe. Reckless driving,
            use of poorly maintained vehicles and lack of respect for traffic laws are common. Keep
            windows closed and doors locked at all times. Avoid driving after dark in rural areas
            and on the main road between Yaoundé and Douala. The presence of livestock and
            pedestrians on the roadway, and the lack of road and traffic signs pose hazards. Local
            police roadblocks are erected throughout the country, and you may be expected to make
            payments. Ask the officer to provide a ticket with a description of the violation(s).
            This ticket can be paid at a local court or at a police station.

            Particular attention should be paid when travelling on roads in the Far North region
            near the Nigerian border. These regions, especially between Garoua and Kousseri in the
            Northern regions, are notorious for armed highway bandits, or "coupeurs de routes".
            Four-wheel-drive vehicles are targeted.

            In the event of an accident, you should, if possible, go to the next police station or
            to the High Commission of Canada in Yaoundé or to the Consulate of Canada in Douala to
            get assistance.

            If travelling overland, carry sufficient supplies of water, food and fuel, as well as a
            reliable means of communication, such as a satellite or cellular telephone.

            It is difficult to depart Cameroon via the land borders with Gabon and the Central
            African Republic due to poor road conditions, particularly during the rainy season. The
            border with Equatorial Guinea is frequently closed. You are advised to contact local
            authorities for the most current information.

            You should always carry your driving permit and your vehicle\'s registration documents.

            Buses link Yaoundé to Douala, Bafoussam, Bamenda, Foumban and Dschang. Trains run daily
            between Yaoundé and the cities of N\'Gaoundéré and Douala. Regular flights connect
            Yaoundé, Douala, Maroua, Garoua, N\'Gaoundéré and several other cities.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            General safety information

            Carefully evaluate the security risks before deciding to travel to any location in
            Cameroon. Monitor news reports, and follow the advice of local authorities.

            Stay informed of the security situation in the region in which you are travelling, and
            ensure that your hotel is safe.

            You should carry certified copies of identification and travel documents at all times
            and keep originals in a safe place, such as a hotel safe. Tourist facilities are
            limited. Avoid shopping on the street. If possible, have a guide or buy from established
            shops.

            Energy supply is poorly managed and power outages occur all over the country.
            Inadvertent power cuts are a daily occurrence and may last over eight hours. You are
            advised to turn off your electrical appliances before leaving your place of residence.
            Domestic gas may also be in short supply, especially during holiday periods such as
            December and January.

            Crime

            Incidents of robbery and assault, including sexual assault, occasionally occur. Ensure
            that your personal belongings, passports and other travel documents are secure at all
            times. Do not bring personal belongings to the beach. Avoid solo trips to deserted
            beaches or poorly lit areas after dark.
            Spiked foods and drinks

            Never leave food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers. Be wary of accepting
            snacks, beverages, gum, or cigarettes from new acquaintances, as they may contain drugs
            that could put you at risk of sexual assault and robbery.
            Road travel

            Road conditions may be poor.

            Safe public minibuses run on the main roads.

            Taxis, mopeds, scooters and rental cars are widely available. Some rental agencies’
            insurance may not cover drivers under the age of 25.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            Emergency services

            Dial 911 to reach police, fire fighters and medical assistance.

            Political and security situation

            In March 2013, a coalition of rebel forces known as Seleka entered the capital, Bangui,
            and overthrew the government. In January 2014, a transitional government was
            established. The security remains unstable throughout the country despite the
            stabilization mission of the United Nations. Sectarian violence is frequent and has
            resulted in thousands of deaths.

            A curfew is in effect in Bangui from 6 p.m. to 5 a.m. Official and unofficial roadblocks
            are set up throughout the country.

            Law enforcement personnel throughout the country are unable to ensure the security of
            civilians. If you are in CAR despite this advisory, take the necessary precautions to
            stay safe. There is no resident Canadian government office in CAR. The ability of the
            Government of Canada to provide consular assistance or assist your departure is
            extremely limited.

            The border with Chad is closed.
            Prefecture of Haut Mbomou

            Incursions into the prefecture of Haut-Mbomou, in southeastern CAR, by the Lord\'s
            Resistance Army (LRA) have escalated, especially between the town of Zemio and the
            border with South Sudan. The security situation is highly volatile and the local
            population continues to flee the attacks.

            In December 2008, troops from Uganda, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Sudan
            launched a joint military offensive against bases of the LRA in northern DRC. Since the
            launch of the joint campaign, the LRA has dispersed and retaliated with great violence
            against the civilian population in villages located in border areas with South Sudan and
            Uganda. Many people have been killed and thousands more have fled the region. Ugandan,
            Congolese and South Sudanese forces, and the United Nations Mission to the DRC, have
            been increasing their presence and operations in the area. United States Special Forces
            have been deployed to the area to provide training and support to the Central African
            Army in the south-eastern region of the country.
            Crime

            The country is affected by rebel activity, armed attacks and banditry. Sectarian
            violence is frequent. Some attacks have been indiscriminate. Shootings and looting have
            increased since 2013. Westerners and employees of international organizations have been
            targeted for attacks and kidnapped. The risk of abduction has increased in 2015 for both
            nationals and foreigners.

            Theft is prevalent. Ensure your personal belongings are secure, and do not show signs of
            affluence. You should carry only certified copies of your travel documents.

            Acts of violence frequently occur at the KM5 market in Bangui.
            Demonstrations

            Public gatherings and areas where demonstrations may occur should be avoided, as some
            have turned violent in the past. Avoid moving about the city during times of civil
            unrest.
            Transportation

            For the time being, it is recommended that any road travel outside Bangui be avoided.
            Roads are poor throughout the country, and the only paved roads lead out from Bangui 157
            km northwest to Bossembélé, 188 km northeast to Sibut and 107 km southwest to M\'Baiiki.
            Dirt roads can be closed for hours or for days during the wet season. Buses, trucks and
            minibuses are the normal means of transportation.

            Although remote areas can normally be accessed with four-wheel-drive vehicles, some
            roads may be impassable during the rainy season (May to October). In the event of an
            accident involving injuries, you should go to the nearest police station and contact the
            Consulate of Canada in Bangui. Police and military may set up roadblocks.

            If you decide to undertake road travel despite this warning, keep in mind that all
            overland travel outside the capital should be done in a convoy of at least two vehicles
            and during daylight hours. Regional wars have increased access to weapons, and armed
            attacks occur, often consisting of highway robbery. Overland points of entry are closed
            to tourists since no security arrangements are provided for foreigners travelling
            outside the capital.

            Fuel shortages are common. Fuel reserves are recommended when travelling.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            General safety information

            Tourist facilities are not widely available.

            Ebola

            The border with Nigeria is closed due to the Ebola outbreak.
            Increased threat of attacks and kidnappings

            In 2013, the French military assisted the Malian government in efforts to repel armed
            rebels. Terrorist groups in the region declared their intention to increase attacks and
            kidnappings targeting Westerners. While the United Nations peacekeeping mission in Mali
            has been supporting the transitional authorities in stabilizing the region since July
            2013, citizens of countries supporting the intervention are still at particular risk,
            but all travellers should exercise increased vigilance in the region.
            Northern Chad (see Advisory)

            Travel in northern Chad, especially in the Borkou-Ennedi-Tibesti region, is considered
            dangerous. The presence of landmines has been reported along the border with Libya.
            Attempting to cross the border would be hazardous. Border closure can occur without
            notice.
            Western Chad (see Advisory)

            Contraband from Cameroon is frequently smuggled across the Chari River, which can result
            in armed intervention by Chadian customs and river police. Rural areas around Lake Chad
            are also subject to periodic violence.

            A state of emergency is in effect in the Nigerian state of Borno, which borders Chad.
            Instability in this province could spill over into Chad.
            Border with Sudan and the Central African Republic (see Advisory)

            In the border areas with Sudan and the Central African Republic, rebel groups are active
            and create an extremely insecure situation. Attacks have occurred in these areas and
            there is a serious threat of kidnapping against foreigners. The humanitarian situation
            in eastern Chad (including the regions of Biltine and Ouaddaï) is serious, given the
            ongoing potential for trans-border clashes and the presence of hundreds of thousands of
            Sudanese refugees who have fled the conflict in Darfur. Targeted attacks on humanitarian
            workers by bandits and armed militias have increased, and several local non-governmental
            organizations (NGOs) have suspended or reduced operations. You should exercise extreme
            caution in and around the city of Abéché, where violent incidents have been reported.
            The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR ) recommends
            travelling in convoys of at least two vehicles and avoiding all movements in the region
            after 6:00 p.m. There are live minefields in this region. Crossing the border anywhere
            in this area is extremely dangerous.
            N’Djamena (see Advisory)

            Avoid all non-essential travel to the capital city of N’Djamena. There is a risk of
            violence, kidnapping and serious crime in N’Djamena. Travellers entering or exiting the
            capital must go through security check points. If travel outside N\'Djamena is
            necessary, a permit issued by the Ministry of Interior is required. The permit may take
            several days to be issued. Outside N’Djamena, telecommunication systems are very
            unreliable. Travellers with Thuraya satellite phones should register the phones with the
            Chadian authorities. You are advised to hire a local driver to avoid being the victim of
            mob justice in response to a road accident.
            Crime

            Pickpockets and purse snatchers are active in market and commercial areas. Do not show
            signs of affluence and leave valuables and personal belongings, including cash and
            airline tickets, in a hotel safe or other secure place. Dress conservatively and avoid
            walking alone, especially after dark. Burglary and vehicle theft increase during periods
            of political instability. Banditry is common. Foreigners are increasingly targeted,
            particularly at night.
            Road travel

            Road conditions are dangerous. Roads are poorly maintained and mostly unpaved, even in
            N’Djamena. Streets are poorly lit and road signs are often missing. Excessive speeds,
            erratic driving habits, lack of vehicle maintenance, roaming wildlife and livestock,
            cyclists, and pedestrians pose risks. You are advised not to travel between cities at
            night due to poor road infrastructure.

            Emergency services do not exist.

            Fuel is not always available in major cities and is very scarce in rural areas.

            You should travel in convoy outside N\'Djamena, during daylight hours only and carry
            additional fuel, a spare tire and provisions.

            Keep windows closed and doors locked at all times. You should stop and cooperate at all
            police or military roadblocks. Proper identification should be readily available.
            Public transportation

            There is no operational train or bus network in Chad. Trucks and minibuses are not
            properly maintained and are often dangerous. They are not recommended for any intercity
            travel.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.

            Terrorism

            Several small scale explosive devices have been detonated in Santiago since mid-July
            2014, mainly targeting public transportation and automated banking machines (ABMs). On
            September 8, 2014, an explosion occurred during daylight hours near a metro station,
            injuring several people. Remain vigilant, be aware of your surroundings, exercise a high
            degree of caution when using public transportation, and report any suspicious behavior
            or unattended packages to local authorities.
            Crime

            Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, has increased, particularly in
            Santiago, Valparaíso, Calama and Viña del Mar. Small bags and purses have been stolen
            from hotel and hostel lobbies, and from the backs of chairs at bars and restaurants. Do
            not show signs of affluence, and ensure that your personal belongings, passport and
            other travel documents are secure at all times.

            Robberies and assaults occur most frequently in the Santiago, Viña del Mar, Valparaíso
            and Calama areas. Thieves are active in crowded tourist locations, markets, metro
            (subway) stations, trains, buses and taxis, as well as cafés and restaurants popular
            with foreigners. In Valparaíso, remain particularly alert in the port and adjoining
            tourist areas. Avoid poorer residential areas (poblaciones).

            Muggings, sometimes involving the use of fire arms, have been reported in Cerro San
            Cristóbal Park, and in other parks in the Santiago area, even during the day. Be
            vigilant in parks, and avoid them at night.

            Never leave food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers. Pay attention when
            drinks are prepared and served, especially in the Bellavista neighbourhood of Santiago.
            Be wary of accepting snacks, beverages, gum or cigarettes from new acquaintances, as
            they may contain drugs that could put you at risk of sexual assault and robbery.

            Take care when driving a rental car or taking a taxi in Valparaíso. Thieves have
            punctured tires in order to distract foreigners and steal their belongings from the
            vehicle.

            There have been reports of politically motivated violence involving indigenous
            communities in southern Chile (specifically in the Araucanía region), but no foreigners
            have been directly affected. If travelling in the Araucanía region, it is recommended
            that you travel during the day.
            Demonstrations and civil unrest

            Demonstrations occur regularly in Santiago and Valparaíso, and occasionally elsewhere in
            the country. Student protests occur intermittently, causing road blocks, public
            transportation disruptions and confrontations with police. You should be particularly
            vigilant on March 29, the day of the Young Combatant, and on September 11, the
            anniversary of the 1973 coup, as these dates are often marked by large demonstrations.
            Monitor local news reports, follow the advice of local authorities, and avoid large
            crowds and demonstrations, as they may turn violent with little to no warning.
            Landmines

            Demarcated landmine fields are a danger in remote areas of the northern regions of
            Arica-Parinacota, Tarapaca and Antofagasta in the north, remote areas of Valparaíso in
            central Chile, and in the southern regions of Magallanes and Antártica, near the border
            with Argentina. Landmine fields are also found in remote sections of several popular
            national parks, including Lauca and Llullaillaco national parks, the Salar de Surire
            National Monument and the Los Flamencos National Reserve. Check with park staff or local
            authorities before entering less-travelled areas and observe all warning signs.
            Road travel

            Driving standards are poor. Accident rates, particularly in Santiago, are high. Keep
            windows closed and doors locked at all times. Major highways are mostly toll roads.
            Ensure that you carry sufficient local currency to pay the tolls. Do not venture off
            major highways with basic or small rental vehicles. Secondary roads are sometimes poorly
            maintained and/or poorly lit. Driving on mountain roads can be dangerous due to the lack
            of guard rails. Traffic police (carabineros) presence is very visible on highways. Have
            vehicle documentation ready. Ensure that you have written authorization from your rental
            agency if you intend to travel outside the country in a rental vehicle. The
            authorization must be requested from the car rental company three to five days before
            the trip, and a processing fee applies. If you are using a private vehicle, the owner
            must provide you with proper authorization.

            Traffic congestion in downtown Santiago is common during peak hours. Certain major
            arteries alternate traffic direction during morning and evening rush hours. For
            up-to-date information, call the traffic police (carabineros) at 139.
            Taxis

            Taxis are plentiful and inexpensive. Agree to a fare beforehand. Taxis with illuminated
            signs indicating their destination are "collective" taxis. These follow a fixed route
            and are shared by up to five passengers.

            Taxis and radio-taxis can be booked and prepaid at the airport. Airport-registered
            transportation is recommended. Major hotels will arrange to meet travellers upon
            arrival. Shuttle minibuses are also available.
            Air travel

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            Emergency services

            Dial 133 for police, 132 for the fire department, and 131 for a public ambulance.

            Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region

            Sporadic violent clashes occur in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. Attacks using
            explosive devices, firearms and knives have taken place, often resulting in deaths and
            injuries. Unrest and sporadic acts of violence are expected to continue. The presence of
            armed police is visible, and local authorities continue to monitor the situation very
            closely. Curfews and restrictions may be imposed on short notice. Attacks do not
            specifically target tourists or foreigners, but the danger of being in the wrong place
            at the wrong time is always present. Avoid gatherings and demonstrations, and follow the
            instructions of local authorities.
            Crime

            Petty crime, such as pickpocketing, purse snatching, and theft of mobile phones and
            laptop computers, is prevalent, even during the day. Foreigners are targeted, especially
            in major cities and tourist areas. Be vigilant in all crowded locations, including
            tourist sites, trade fairs, restaurants, coffee shops, Internet cafés, markets and
            department stores. Do not carry large sums of money. Secure valuables, with the
            exception of passports, in hotel safe-deposit facilities. Violent crime is relatively
            rare, although foreigners have been attacked and robbed.

            Petty crime and sexual harassment occur on buses and overnight trains. Ensure that the
            train compartment contains packages belonging only to you and other occupants. Store
            personal belongings in a safe place and do not leave the compartment unattended. Doors
            should be securely locked.

            Cases of extortion by taxi, motorcycle and pedicab drivers have increased. Foreigners
            have also been approached by strangers and invited to a nearby establishment for a drink
            (usually tea or alcohol). They were then presented with an exorbitant bill (sometimes
            hundreds of dollars) and forced to pay under threat of injury. In some cases, the person
            was harmed. Be cautious of unsolicited requests from strangers to "practice English" or
            to accompany them to an “art gallery” or unknown location, and telephone scams where the
            caller claims you are being investigated by local authorities. See our Overseas fraud
            page for more information on scams abroad.

            Since early 2014, a number of explosions and knife attacks have occurred in public
            places, including in busy railway stations, resulting in injuries and fatalities.

            There is a risk of armed bandit attacks in remote parts of China. Police presence is
            poor in areas bordering Burma, Laos, Pakistan, Russia and Vietnam.
            Demonstrations

            Demonstrations are illegal and should be avoided. Participants may be subject to severe
            legal action.
            Transportation

            Poor driving standards and poor road conditions outside major cities make travelling
            hazardous. Travelling after dark outside major cities is not recommended.

            China has an extensive system of passenger trains. Most trains are slow, although there
            are express trains on the well-travelled routes. Taxis are plentiful in major cities and
            can be obtained at hotels or taxi stands. Most taxi drivers do not speak English or
            French, so you should arrange for a Chinese-speaking person to write out your
            destination in detail on a card before you go. Rental cars are available only in the
            largest cities, generally with a driver.

            Ferry accidents have occurred in China due to overcrowding. Exercise caution and common
            sense when using marine transportation and do not board ferries that are overloaded.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            Piracy

            Pirate attacks occur in coastal waters and, in some cases, farther out at sea. Mariners
            should take appropriate precautions. For additional information, consult the Live Piracy
            Report published by the International Maritime Bureau.
            Trekking

            If you intend to trek:

            a) never trek alone;
            b) always hire an experienced guide and ensure that the trekking company is reputable;
            c) buy travel health insurance that includes helicopter rescue and medical evacuation;
            d) ensure that you are in top physical condition;
            e) advise a family member or friend of your itinerary;
            f) know the symptoms of acute altitude sickness, which can be fatal;
            g) register with a Canadian government office in China; and
            h) obtain detailed information on trekking routes before setting out.

            Illegal armed groups (see Advisory)

            The presence of armed drug traffickers, guerrilla groups—including the Revolutionary
            Armed Forces of Colombia and the National Liberation Army—and other armed groups pose a
            major risk to travellers, especially in rural areas. These groups continue to perpetrate
            attacks, extortion, kidnappings, car bombings and damage to infrastructure. Landmines
            continue to be used by guerrilla groups.

            If you intend to travel to remote areas for eco-tourism or to visit archaeological sites
            despite this Advisory, you should do so with an experienced and reputable tour guide
            only. Plan your itinerary well in advance and seek professional security advice. Avoid
            travelling at night, stay at areas frequented by tourists, and follow the advice of
            local authorities. Note that you may be denied entry to certain areas by local
            authorities due to emerging security threats.
            Terrorism

            There are two known terrorist groups active in Colombia, the Revolutionary Armed Forces
            of Colombia (FARC) and the National Liberation Army (ELN). Possible terrorist targets
            include military and police vehicles and installations, restaurants, underground
            garages, nightclubs, hotels, banks, shopping centres, public transportation vehicles,
            government buildings, and airports located in major cities. The Government of Colombia
            continues negotiations with the FARC to bring an end to the conflict; however, there is
            currently no ceasefire in place. Remain vigilant, avoid any unattended packages or
            parcels, and bring them to the attention of security personnel. Follow the advice and
            instructions of local authorities and monitor media for updates. Avoid travel to the
            areas of the country listed in the Advisories section.
            Crime

            Although there have been significant improvements to Colombia’s security situation,
            petty and violent crime, including pickpocketing, assault, robbery, car bombing,
            hijacking and murder, is still common throughout the country. Exercise extreme caution,
            dress down, avoid wearing jewellery and keep cameras and electronic equipment out of
            sight. Carry minimal sums of money and leave your passport and other travel documents
            locked in your hotel safe.

            Arrive at Medellín’s José Maria Córdova International Airport during the day to avoid
            the road from the airport to the city after dark.

            Remain vigilant and be aware of your surroundings at all times when travelling in larger
            cities, such as Bogotá, Medellín and Cali. Muggings and assaults occur even in safer
            parts of these cities, and some neighbourhoods should be avoided at all times due to
            high crime rates. Check with your hotel or other reliable contacts in the city you are
            visiting to determine which areas should be avoided.

            There has been an increase in assaults and robberies against foreigners at hostels in
            Colombia, particularly in Bogotá and Cartagena. If you opt to stay at hostels, be highly
            vigilant and carefully evaluate your personal security situation.

            Avoid the southern parts of Bogotá, especially the neighbourhoods of Soacha and Ciudad
            Bolivar. Avoid the downtown area (Candelaria and surrounding neighbourhoods) after dark,
            and avoid the neighbourhoods of Kennedy and Usaquen (north of calle 153) at all times.

            In Medellín, avoid the city centre after dark and avoid areas not covered by the metro
            system. Although some of the "comunas" (municipalities on the periphery of the city) are
            serviced by the cablecar system ("Metrocable"), you should avoid them at all times.

            In Cali you should remain in the hotel zone and the south of the city; you should avoid
            all other parts of Cali. Violent crimes have recently been reported even in wealthier
            neighbourhoods and shopping malls.

            Avoid going to bars alone. Never leave food or drinks unattended or in the care of
            strangers. Be wary of accepting snacks, beverages, gum or cigarettes from new
            acquaintances, as they may contain drugs that could put you at risk of sexual assault
            and robbery. Drugs such as scopolamine have been reportedly blown into the faces of
            victims on the street. Exercise extreme caution when dealing with strangers.

            Business travellers and Canadian companies establishing operations in Colombia should
            take enhanced security measures to protect both personnel and company assets. Choose
            living accommodations that have significant security measures in place, and modern
            office facilities. Consult the commercial section of the Embassy of Canada in Bogotá for
            more information and advice.

            There have been reports of thieves posing as police officers and approaching foreigners
            to verify their documents or foreign currency. If approached, do not hand over money or
            documents unless you feel threatened—in which case you should not resist—and then
            request to do so at your hotel or other public place to maximize your safety.

            National parks, wildlife refuges, and city outskirts are often convenient hideouts for
            illegal groups. Armed clashes are frequent in such areas. If visiting these
            destinations, remain in tourist areas, as they are usually safer and are more frequently
            patrolled by police.

            In the tourist resort areas of San Andrés Island, Providencia Island and Cartagena,
            criminal activity and violence directed at tourists is low compared to other
            destinations in the region. Exercise common sense and normal security precautions in
            these areas.
            Kidnapping

            Colombia has one of the highest kidnapping rates in the world. While kidnapping is
            primarily aimed at Colombians, foreigners can be targeted by guerrilla groups in all
            parts of the country, especially foreigners working for (or perceived to be working for)
            oil and mining companies.

            "Express kidnappings" are frequent and often occur in affluent areas as well as in
            tourist areas. Victims are usually kidnapped from the street and forced to withdraw
            funds from an automated banking machine (ABM). Victims are sometimes held overnight so
            that a second withdrawal can be made the next day. Victims may be sexually assaulted
            during the kidnapping. Uncooperative victims have been injured or killed.
            Demonstrations and civil unrest

            Demonstrations, major strikes, and acts of violence by terrorist groups may occur. Avoid
            all large gatherings and demonstrations, especially in large cities, follow the advice
            of local authorities and monitor local media.
            Road travel

            Road travel in Colombia, including Bogotá, is extremely dangerous. Most roadways are in
            poor condition and are often congested. Traffic laws are not enforced by police, traffic
            signs and controls are ignored, and drivers are frequently distracted and can be
            aggressive and/or drunk. Pedestrians do not have the right of way, including at stop
            signs.

            When travelling by car, place all belongings in the trunk and keep your doors locked at
            all times. Carry a cellular telephone and park your car in a guarded parking lot.

            In some rural areas, illegal armed groups may set up roadblocks targeting the well‑off
            for robbery or kidnapping for ransom. Roadblocks may disrupt local transportation and
            affect travel to and from airports.

            Travel by air when covering long distances and do not enter or leave Colombia over land
            borders. Any road travel should be done during the day using main roads only. Road
            closures may occur between Bogotá and Villavicencio and in the Magdalena Medio region
            (Barrancabermeja), and are more frequent in the departments of Guajira, Bolívar,
            Antioquia, Santander, Norte de Santander and Putumayo.

            Avoid travelling on the Pan-American highway in the south-west departments of Colombia,
            where a series of explosions has occurred since late 2014.
            Public transportation

            Public transportation is not safe; buses and, to a lesser extent, taxis are frequent
            targets for criminals. Rural buses are often stopped by guerrillas. Do not hail taxis on
            the street, as express kidnappings often occur in unlicensed taxis; rather, book them
            through your hotel or through an authorized and controlled taxi centre and take note of
            the licence plate number. If you have to hail a taxi on the street, avoid cabs without
            licence plates and do not enter a cab if it is already occupied by anyone but the
            driver. Many taxi drivers are armed. Smartphone applications are available that allow
            you to order safe taxis, which are monitored by GPS.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.

            Crime

            Although infrequent, petty crime such as pick-pocketing, purse snatching and theft from
            unlocked cars occurs. Exercise caution in crowded outdoor markets, parks and beaches.
            Ensure that personal belongings, passport, and other travel documents are secure at all
            times. It is not recommended to walk alone at night.
            Demonstrations

            Political instability, including frequent strikes and civil unrest, has plagued the
            islands. Police and demonstrators have clashed in the past, and further incidents are
            possible. Foreigners have not been targeted, but you should exercise caution and avoid
            all demonstrations and public gatherings. You should contact the High Commission of
            Canada in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania for the latest security information.
            Piracy

            Pirate attacks occur in coastal waters and, in some cases, farther out at sea. Mariners
            should take appropriate precautions. For additional information, consult the Live Piracy
            Report published by the International Maritime Bureau.
            Road travel

            Roads are narrow and poorly lit. Although most urban roads are paved, many rural roads
            are not. Exercise extreme caution when driving at night. Emergency and roadside
            assistance is non-existent. In the event of an accident, travellers should proceed to
            the nearest police station. Taxis and car rentals are available.
            Sea travel

            It is possible to travel between the islands by boat. You should avoid boats that are in
            poor condition or overcrowded, as there have been incidents of boats capsizing in the
            past.
            Air travel

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            General safety information

            Tourist facilities are limited. Telecommunications are unreliable. Water shortages and
            power cuts occur.

            For emergency assistance, dial (269) 77 34 663.

            Crime

            Petty crime occurs. Ensure that your personal belongings, passports and other travel
            documents are secure at all times.
            Transportation

            Traffic drives on the left. Coastal roads in Rarotonga are paved. Driving at night can
            be dangerous due to poor visibility and road conditions.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            Swimming and water sports

            Injuries and fatalities have occurred due to tidal changes and breaks in the reefs. Seek
            local advice on which parts of the lagoon are safe for swimming. Reef shoes are
            recommended.

            Sports and aquatic equipment may not meet Canadian safety standards and may not be
            covered by your insurance. Ensure that your travel insurance covers these activities if
            you decide to rent equipment or take classes.

            Crime

            Crime is a significant problem throughout Costa Rica.

            If you are a victim of a crime, report it to the closest Oficina del Organismo de
            Investigación Judicial (Judicial Investigation Department Office) to ensure that local
            authorities can conduct an investigation. Plainclothes police, known locally as “OIJ”
            are responsible for taking police reports and conducting investigations. It is
            especially important to report the loss or theft of your identification documents, both
            to Costa Rican authorities and to the Canadian Embassy in Costa Rica, in order to
            protect yourself should the documents later be misused.

            Local emergency services are reachable by calling 911”.
            Theft

            Petty crime—including pickpocketing and bag snatching—occurs frequently in Costa Rica.
            Tourists are common targets for theft because they are perceived as being wealthy. Avoid
            showing signs of affluence and never leave valuables such as money, credit cards,
            jewellery and electronics unattended, especially on beaches. Stay at hotels and rental
            houses that have security measures such as guards and security cameras. Avoid walking
            alone at night.

            Foreigners are often victims of theft on buses and at bus stations, airports, ports,
            crowded tourist attractions, restaurants and resort areas. When travelling by public
            bus, avoid placing personal belongings in the overhead compartment or under your seat.
            Keep your bag with valuables and identification in your lap. Thieves often work in
            teams, in which one thief diverts the victims’ attention while the other snatches their
            possessions.

            Theft from vehicles is very common, especially at supermarkets, restaurants and store
            lots. Do not leave your passport or your valuables in the car, even if you leave the car
            for only a few minutes. Park your vehicle in supervised public parking lots (Parqueos
            Públicos), if possible. Beware of “good Samaritans” offering to help change a flat tire,
            as they may have punctured the car’s tires themselves and intend to steal items from
            your car while you are distracted. Calmly refuse the help and contact Costa Rican
            authorities and the rent-a-car agency if you have a rental car. Don’t stop to change a
            flat tire in an isolated area, and keep the doors of the vehicle locked while changing a
            tire. When renting a car, you should find out if emergency assistance is offered by the
            rent-a-car agency for an additional fee.

            Exercise vigilance with your travel documents. Cases of passport theft, including cases
            involving Canadians, are extremely common and increase in frequency during the peak
            tourist seasons, from November to May and from July to August. Carry a photocopy of the
            identification page of your passport, including the Costa Rican entry stamp, with you at
            all times. Keep your original documents in a secure place, such as a hotel safe.

            Remain alert to your surroundings throughout the country, particularly near the ports of
            Limón and Puntarenas. In San José, high-risk areas for theft include the Coca Cola bus
            station, the inner downtown area and public parks. On the Atlantic coast, be
            particularly cautious in Puerto Viejo and Cahuita; on the Pacific coast, Tamarindo,
            Jacó, Quepos, Manuel Antonio and Dominical are areas of particular concern for theft.
            Cars parked near the popular crocodile viewing area along the Tárcoles River near Jacó
            are particularly vulnerable to theft.
            Violent crime

            Violent crime against foreigners is a concern. Armed robberies and home invasions occur,
            including in beach areas and on main highways in the Central Valley. Carjackings also
            occur, often at gunpoint. Do as the gunmen ask without hesitation. Remain vigilant when
            stopped at lights or stop signs, and always drive with the doors locked and windows
            closed. Keep your valuables out of plain sight when driving and minimize travel at
            night.

            Cases of express kidnapping, where victims are picked up from the street and forced to
            withdraw funds from automated banking machines (ABMs), have occurred. Remain cautious
            with new acquaintances offering friendship, hospitality or assistance.

            Incidents of sexual assault against foreigners have been reported. Foreigners have been
            sexually assaulted at beach resorts as well as by taxi drivers in San José. Only use
            official taxis (orange taxis at the airport and red with a yellow triangle on the side
            elsewhere in the country) and avoid those that do not have working door handles, locks
            and meters. Do not ride in the front seat with the driver. As incidents of sexual
            assault sometimes involve the use of sedative drugs, avoid leaving your drinks or food
            unattended in bars and nightclubs. If you are a victim of sexual assault, report it to
            police, as support and guidance is given by local authorities to victims. Before
            travelling, consult our publication entitled Her Own Way: A Woman’s Safe-Travel Guide
            for travel safety information specifically aimed at Canadian women.

            Drug trafficking is increasing in Costa Rica. Local consumption of illicit narcotics,
            particularly crack cocaine, is a concern in the country, along with the continued rise
            in drug-related violent crimes. Be aware of your surroundings at all times.
            Demonstrations

            Occasional demonstrations occur in the capital, which may cause traffic disruptions.
            Strikes also sometimes take place and disrupt local services. Exercise caution, avoid
            large crowds and stay informed of possible roadblocks.
            Road travel

            Costa Rica has one of the highest traffic accident rates in the world. Exercise great
            caution when driving or walking, since traffic laws are routinely ignored. In some
            areas, potholes, sharp curves, lack of traffic signs, landslides and narrow or unpaved
            roads create dangerous road conditions. Be careful after dark, especially on rural
            roads, as motorists often drive without lights at night. Travelling by road during the
            rainy season is particularly dangerous, given the increased risk of flooding and
            landslides.

            Camera monitoring systems have been installed in various locations. Speeding fines are
            automatically charged to individuals exceeding the speed limit.

            Only use official taxis. At the airport, licensed taxis are orange; other official taxis
            are red with a yellow triangle on the side.

            Public bus transportation is unreliable.

            Police checks of public transportation occur and are often used to determine whether
            foreigners have overstayed the 90-day visa exemption period.
            Maritime travel

            If navigating the coasts of Costa Rica, proceed with caution, as safety and rescue
            operations are limited due to a lack of resources. There have been cases where Costa
            Rica’s National Coast Guard Service has sought the assistance of the U.S. Coast Guard,
            resulting in delayed rescue operations.
            Air travel

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            General security information

            More than 80 people drowned in 2013. Riptides are very common on both the Caribbean and
            Pacific coasts. Few beaches are supervised or have signs warning of dangerous
            conditions. Seek the advice of local authorities before swimming. The Costa Rican
            Tourism Bureau’s website www.visitcostarica.com (multimedia/brochures) provides
            important advice on safety matters such as swimming in the ocean and avoiding
            crocodiles.

            Safety features on small boats are not always reliable. White-water rafting, scuba
            diving, bungee jumping, canopy touring and other adventure sports should only be
            undertaken with a well-established company. If you have any doubt concerning the
            security of the installation or equipment, refrain from using them.

            Avoid camping or sleeping overnight on beaches.

            If you intend to visit jungle areas, always go with an experienced and reputable guide.

            Few services outside major hotels are available in either English or French. Most taxi
            drivers, police officers, lawyers and hospital workers do not speak English or French.
            Emergency services

            Costa Rica has created a tourism police force (Policía Turística) dedicated to improving
            the security of foreigners. Dial 911 for police assistance. Service is available in
            English.

            Border with Liberia (see Advisory)

            Although the number of incidents has decreased significantly in the last two years,
            armed attacks, aimed mainly at positions of the Republican Forces of Côte d’Ivoire,
            still occur along the border with Liberia.
            Increased threat of attacks and kidnappings

            In 2013, the French military assisted the Malian government in efforts to repel armed
            rebels. Terrorist groups in the region declared their intention to increase attacks and
            kidnappings targeting Westerners. While the United Nations peacekeeping mission in Mali
            has been supporting the transitional authorities in stabilizing the region since July
            2013, citizens of countries supporting the intervention are still at particular risk,
            but all travellers should exercise increased vigilance in the region.
            Abidjan

            You should maintain a high level of security awareness, particularly in the
            neighbourhoods of Treichville, Adjamé, Abobo and Yopougon, due to the risk of theft and
            mugging.

            Refrain from crossing the Charles de Gaulle and Houphouët-Boigny bridges on foot, as
            pedestrians have been assaulted there, even in broad daylight. Do not walk in Le Plateau
            business district at night once offices and shops have closed.

            Be vigilant at night in neighbourhoods where nightclubs, restaurants and maquis (small,
            local clandestine restaurants) are found (such as in Zone 4). Armed robberies,
            carjackings and assaults have been reported there.
            Crime

            Criminal activity is the main threat to your safety and security in Côte d’Ivoire. In
            Abidjan and other cities in the country, you could be the target of petty crime such as
            pickpocketing or purse snatching. Petty criminals do not hesitate to use force when
            faced with resistance. Burglaries, break-ins and violent assaults are also frequent, as
            is car theft. Luxury and four-wheel drive vehicles are particularly targeted. Keep your
            vehicle’s doors locked and windows closed at all times.

            Crime increases significantly after dark; be especially careful after sundown and avoid
            travel late at night.
            Highway robbers

            Armed bandits (coupeurs de route or highwaymen) sometimes strike along the country’s
            highways. They erect barricades to stop vehicles and rob passengers. Although this
            phenomenon has become much less common, incidents are regularly reported along primary
            and secondary roads. These bandits are active mainly at night, but attacks also occur in
            broad daylight.
            Demonstrations

            Demonstrations and large gatherings have the potential to degenerate into violence or
            deadly stampedes. Avoid all demonstrations and large gatherings, follow the advice of
            local authorities and monitor local media.
            Road travel

            Côte d’Ivoire has a fairly good road system. A new two-lane highway links Abidjan and
            Yamoussoukro. Main roads are generally paved, but the remainder are not. Although the
            road system is generally in good condition, several stretches of road are still full of
            potholes and are buckled in places.

            Road accidents are common, due to poor road conditions, excessive speeds and careless
            driving. Drive defensively at all times and respect speed limits.

            When a vehicle is stopped in heavy traffic, doors should be locked and windows closed at
            all times. You should always carry your identification and vehicle documents. It is
            recommended that you avoid travelling after nightfall, owing to poorly lit roads and the
            risk of accident or holdup.
            Public transportation

            Public transportation is inadequate in Abidjan and is not recommended. Buses are
            overcrowded and although taxis are available, they are generally in poor condition and
            their drivers are reckless. If you must absolutely take a taxi, you should either insist
            that the meter be turned on and pay only the indicated price, or negotiate the fare in
            advance. There have been incidents of taxi passengers being robbed or assaulted by
            drivers, so be very cautious. Do not allow the driver to pick up any other passengers on
            the way to your destination, as this may be a prearranged scheme to attack or rob you.
            Avoid using informal taxis (woro-woros) and buses (gbaka) on the road in Abidjan.
            Airport

            Major hotels provide a shuttle service to and from the airport; it is best to book this
            service in advance. There is a risk of baggage theft at the airport, so valuables and
            electronic equipment should be securely locked in hand luggage. All incoming passenger
            luggage is X-rayed before it leaves the terminal, and customs and police officials
            regularly inspect luggage after it has been X-rayed.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            Beaches

            Swimming at the seaside, especially in Grand Bassam, is dangerous and strongly advised
            against, even for excellent swimmers. Coastal ocean currents are powerful and dangerous.
            Many people drown each year.
            Piracy

            Pirate attacks occur in coastal waters and, in some cases, farther out at sea. Mariners
            should take appropriate precautions. For additional information, consult the Live Piracy
            Report published by the International Maritime Bureau.
            General safety information

            Avoid showing signs of affluence and carrying jewelry and large sums of cash. Valuables
            and bags should be kept out of sight. It is also recommended that you vary your
            schedules and travel patterns. Carry certified photocopies of your identification and
            travel documents.
            Fraud

            Cases of attempted fraud are frequently reported in this country. Victims of fraud or
            cybercrime originating from Côte d’Ivoire can report it to Plateforme de lutte contre la
            cybercriminalité. See our Overseas Fraud page for more information on scams abroad.

            Landmines

            Landmines and unexploded ordnance remaining from the 1991-95 war pose a serious risk
            along former front-line areas. Demining operations are expected to continue until at
            least 2019. You should stay on paved roads and avoid ditches, open fields and the
            shoulders of roads in areas where signs indicate the possible presence of landmines.
            While most tourist destinations are not affected, you should contact the Croatian Mine
            Action Centre (e-mail) regarding the presence of unexploded landmines.
            Crime

            Petty crime such as pickpocketing and document theft occurs, especially in busy tourist
            areas and along the Adriatic coast.

            Ethnic tensions exist but rarely become violent.

            Be vigilant if you attend soccer matches. The crowd occasionally becomes rowdy and
            violent.

            In certain establishments, it is legal to charge any price for drinks as long as prices
            are posted. Check prices before placing an order. Some bars and “cabarets” have been
            known to charge exorbitant prices. Discussions about overcharging may lead to threats of
            violence and security guards may force you to pay.
            Demonstrations

            Demonstrations occur periodically and are usually peaceful. Nevertheless, avoid all
            demonstrations and large gatherings, as they have the potential to suddenly turn
            violent. Follow the advice of local authorities and monitor local media.
            Road travel

            Exercise caution when driving on highways and respect speed limits. Travel on small
            roads can be hazardous. Drivers do not always follow safe driving practices. Many roads
            are narrow and poorly maintained. In particular, roads in Istria and along the Adriatic
            coast are narrow, congested, very slippery when wet, and many lack guard rails. Although
            highways cover main routes, some highway segments are not yet completed. Expect heavy
            traffic congestion on major routes on weekends and in the main cities during rush hour.

            For road conditions and safety information, consult the Croatia Traffic Info, published
            by the Croatian automobile association, Hrvatski Autoklub.
            Public transportation

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            Spiked food and drinks

            Never leave your food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers. Be wary of
            accepting snacks, beverages, gum or cigarettes from new acquaintances, as they may
            contain drugs that could put you at risk of sexual assault and robbery.
            Trekking or rock climbing

            Hire an experienced guide and ensure that the company is reputable if you intend to trek
            or rock climb. Buy travel health insurance that includes helicopter rescue and medical
            evacuation.
            General safety information

            Carry adequate identification, such as your passport, at all times. Keep a photocopy of
            your passport in case of loss or seizure.

            Exercise normal safety precautions. Ensure that your personal belongings, passport and
            travel documents are secure at all times, particularly on public transportation and in
            railroad stations and airports.
            Emergency services

            Dial 112 for police, fire fighters or an ambulance.

            Dial 1987 for roadside assistance.

            These services are available in English.

            Crime

            Pickpocketing, theft and assault occur, and Canadians are increasingly reporting being
            victims of these crimes, especially in Havana (the neighbourhoods of Old Havana, Centro
            Havana, the Malecón and Vedado) and on the beaches of Playa del Este and Varadero.

            Theft of items from checked baggage at Cuban airports is frequent. Bags, including
            locked suitcases, are being opened, and items removed. Do not pack valuables in your
            checked luggage. All bags are routinely X-rayed on arrival and departure as part of
            normal local procedure.

            Reports of violent crime are also on the rise. Exercise caution at all times, especially
            in tourist areas and crowded places. Ensure that personal belongings, passport and other
            travel documents are secure at all times. Avoid wearing jewellery or showing signs of
            affluence. If you are robbed, remain calm and do not resist. When reporting a crime to
            local police, you should insist on receiving the document Comprobante de Denuncia as
            confirmation that a report has been made. Police officers may speak only Spanish.
            Road travel

            Avoid driving in Cuba, as driving conditions can be hazardous. Road signs are scarce.
            Bicycles, pedestrians and horse-drawn carts use the middle of the road and do not
            readily give way to oncoming vehicles. Many vehicles are old and poorly maintained.
            Inoperable vehicles are often left on the road until repaired. Few roads are lit and
            some vehicles do not have lights or reflectors. If you must drive, drive defensively at
            all times and avoid driving after dark.

            The Autopista Central (national highway), which runs half the length of the island, is
            generally in good condition. Other roads are generally poor. Allowing hitchhikers into
            your vehicle is not advised.
            Public transportation

            City buses are infrequent and overcrowded. Tour companies offer good bus service between
            airports and the all-inclusive resorts. Buses used for organized day trips from hotels
            are also in good condition.

            Radio taxis are generally reliable. Avoid unlicensed private taxis as well as old model
            private vehicles offered as taxis. The latter are not equipped with safety features such
            as seat belts and air bags and there is no insurance coverage for passengers in case of
            an accident. Yellow, three-wheeled Coco taxis are unsafe and should be avoided.
            Air travel

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            General security information

            Unscheduled electric power surges and outages are common. Most tourist resorts are
            equipped with generators.

            Telephone communication is a problem. Calls are often not answered, even at major
            institutions. Technical problems also exist. Calls may be connected to a different
            number than the one dialled. It often takes repeated tries to place a call to another
            city, particularly after rain. Reliable cell phone service is available in most major
            cities. Cell phones compatible with North American standards can be used in Cuba.
            Canadian cell phones generally function. You may arrange for cell phone service by
            contacting Cubacel at 05 264-2266.

            Crime

            Petty crime occurs. Maintain vigilance as there have been reported cases of violent
            assault. Ensure that your personal belongings, passports and other travel documents are
            secure at all times. Avoid unpopulated areas or unpatrolled beaches after dark. Check
            with local authorities to determine which beaches are safe.
            Road travel

            Major roads are in good condition, but road signs are rare. Wandering animals are a
            hazard. Driving is on the right side of the road, and turning right on red lights is
            prohibited.
            Public transportation

            All taxi drivers carry a badge and labels inside their taxi to identify themselves.
            Taxis have meters with fixed rates for each journey. There are taxi stands at the
            airport, in Punda and Otrobanda, and outside major hotels.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            Emergency services

            For emergency assistance, dial 444444 for police, 112 for ambulance and medical
            assistance, and 114 for the fire department.

        <item>
            Crime

            The crime rate is low but on the rise. Petty crime such as pick pocketing and purse
            snatching is prevalent, particularly in urban areas.
            Road travel

            Exercise caution as driving standards are poor. While modern highways link the major
            cities, rural and mountain roads are often narrow, winding and poorly maintained.
            Enforcement of traffic laws and regulations is inconsistent. Running of red lights,
            speeding and tailgating are common causes of accidents.

            United Nations peacekeeping force patrols the “green line” between the Republic of
            Cyprus in the southern part of the island, and the Turkish Cypriot northern area. You
            can cross the green line in both directions at designated crossing points, including at
            pedestrian-only Ledra Palace and Ledra Street checkpoints in central Nicosia.
            Demonstrations

            Demonstrations and strikes occur periodically, and have the potential to suddenly turn
            violent. Avoid all demonstrations and large gatherings, follow the advice of local
            authorities and monitor local media. Strikes may occasionally interfere with services,
            such as public transport.
            Public transportation

            Public buses are limited but taxis are widely available. Rail service is non-existent.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            Scams

            Be aware that some bars and “cabarets” have been known to overcharge customers for
            drinks. Customers who refused to pay the bill have been threatened.

            Crime

            Violent crime is low, but the number of incidents is rising. Petty crime
            (pick-pocketing, purse snatching) is common, particularly in Prague. Be vigilant in and
            around popular tourist attractions, major hotels and the main railway station (Praha
            Hlavni nadrazi), especially after dark.

            Be very cautious when travelling on public transport. Gangs of thieves target subway
            stations, especially Muzeum, Můstek, Staromĕstská and Malostranská, as well as tram
            route 22 that runs to and from Prague Castle. Thieves may use jostling and swarming
            techniques to rob their victims.
            Road safety

            Rural roads may be uneven, under construction or poorly marked.

            Dial 00 420 1230 for information on road conditions.
            Public transportation

            Use only officially marked taxis, such as Profitaxi, Cititaxi or AAA Radiotaxi (but not
            taxis marked AAA Taxi that charge excessive prices).

            Tickets are required for public transport and these may be purchased at newspaper
            kiosks, metro stations and most hotel reception desks. Anyone caught riding without a
            valid ticket is subject to fines.

            Czech railways provide clean, efficient train service to almost every part of the
            country. Exercise caution on overnight trains from Poland to the Czech Republic as
            robberies have occurred. Store your valuables in a safe place and do not leave your
            compartment unattended. Ensure that the door is secured from the inside.

            Express buses are often faster and more convenient than trains.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            Scams

            Individuals posing as plainclothes police officers may ask you to see your foreign
            currency and passports. Politely decline to cooperate, but offer to go to the nearest
            police station.

            See our Overseas Fraud page for more information on scams abroad.
            Spiked food and drinks

            Never leave food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers. Be wary of accepting
            snacks, beverages, gum, or cigarettes from new acquaintances, as they may contain drugs
            that could put you at risk of sexual assault and robbery.

            Points of entry from Uganda, Burundi and Rwanda (see Advisory)

            Points of entry/exit from Uganda, Burundi and Rwanda should be avoided at all times
            because of the continuing insecurity and lawlessness in these areas. The DRC borders
            with Burundi and Rwanda can be closed on short notice. The border crossings between the
            DRC and Rwanda are closed at Goma and Bukavu from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m.
            Provinces of North and South Kivu (see Advisory)

            Armed conflicts continue despite the signing of peace accords and the presence of UN
            forces. Members of various armed groups involved in these clashes continue to plunder
            and commit violent criminal acts against civilians, including murder, kidnapping, armed
            assault and rape. The resulting humanitarian crisis has contributed to the increase in
            population movements.

            The situation in the Kivus remains very tense and uncertain. A number of armed rebel
            groups operate in the area. Occasional fighting between rebel groups and the Congolese
            army has been taking place north of Goma. During the intense fighting that took place
            between the March 23 Movement (M23) and the Congolese army in late August 2013, some
            rebel shelling hit the city of Goma causing civilian casualties. Rebel forces have since
            been pushed further north. The security situation in and around the Goma-Rutshuru
            corridor remains volatile. If you are in North or South Kivu and assess that your
            security is at risk, leave immediately. Local businesses and services, including the
            airport, are often disrupted in these provinces.
            The Ituri district

            You are advised against all travel to the Ituri district of Orientale province, in the
            northeast of the country, where armed clashes persist despite earlier progress made in
            disarming militia groups. Outside of the main town of Bunia, government security
            structures are weak.
            Garamba National Park and border areas with South Sudan and Uganda

            You are advised against all travel to Garamba National Park and the border areas with
            South Sudan and Uganda in the northeast of the country. Despite the fact that the
            Ugandan, Congolese and South Sudanese armed forces and the UN have intensified their
            operations, the Lord\'s Resistance Army continues to commit acts of violence against the
            civilian population. Many people have been killed and thousands have fled the region.
            Bas-Congo Province (West) (see Advisory)

            You are advised against all non-essential travel to Bas-Congo Province, in the west of
            the country, where followers of the political-religious group Bundu dia Kongo and
            security forces clashed in January and February 2008.
            Ebola

            Screening measures are in place at entry points in an attempt to contain the Ebola
            outbreak.
            Crime

            The DRC is experiencing increased criminality as a result of the current economic crisis
            and the prevailing climate of impunity. A high rate of violent crime and pickpocketing
            is reported in both urban and rural areas, especially after nightfall, in high-density
            public areas and on public transportation. Certain individuals offering discounted
            precious metals and diamonds have robbed foreigners. Avoid walking alone and displaying
            signs of wealth.

            In vehicles, doors must be locked and windows raised. You are advised against leaving
            the main highways, parking in unsupervised areas, and stopping at the scene of an
            accident or at intersections where people are gathered.
            Demonstrations

            There continue to be risks of political or ethnic demonstrations giving rise to acts of
            violence and attacks throughout the country, including attacks against international
            targets. Avoid all demonstrations and large gatherings, follow the advice of local
            authorities and monitor local media.

            Demonstrations have taken place across the country since November 20, 2012, including in
            Kinshasa, Kisangani and Bunia. Further demonstrations could target the MONUSCO, other
            international organizations and non-governmental organizations. It is important to
            exercise extreme caution and to avoid large crowds.
            Roadblocks

            Roadblocks are often set up by people posing as police or military personnel in order to
            rob people travelling at night. You should beware of civilians wearing police or
            military uniforms, or posing as police or military. On occasion, travellers are detained
            and questioned by ill-disciplined security forces at certain legitimate military
            roadblocks throughout the country.

            Local authorities may ask you to present your passport and visa at any time. In such
            situations you are advised to remain calm and cooperative. Persons who fail to comply
            with this regulation could face expulsion. Carry with you a certified copy of your
            passport and visa, which can be obtained at the Canadian embassy in Kinshasa. Your
            original passport should be stored in a secure place at all times.

            You should also check with local authorities to see whether you need to obtain prior
            authorization for in-country travel. You are advised to show your documents through the
            raised window of the vehicle, when possible, to reduce the risk of their being
            temporarily confiscated in an attempt to extract a bribe. If detained, Canadians can
            contact the embassy.
            Public transportation

            There is no reliable public transport system in the DRC. Overcrowded and non-roadworthy
            vans serve as buses in Kinshasa. There is no organized public transit or taxi service in
            Kinshasa as well as in several other parts of the country. The only reliable taxis are
            affiliated with certain large hotels. Few independent taxis are available and most of
            them do not meet safety standards. It is possible to lease a car with or without a
            driver through international companies in Kinshasa.

            Rail service is unsafe. The link between Kamina (Katanga) and the cities of Kindu
            (Maniema) and Kalemie (northern Katanga) is currently interrupted. The link between
            Ilebo and the Katanga via Kananga (western Kasaï) has been restored. Two weekly trains
            connect Kinshasa and Matadi.

            The N’Djili international airport in Kinshasa can close without notice.

            While the ferry service between Kinshasa and Brazzaville is operating, it may be
            interrupted with little or no warning. Boats are often unsafe because of poor
            maintenance and overcrowding, and shipwrecks frequently occur. An entry visa issued by
            the Embassy of the Republic of Congo (Brazzaville) is required to cross the Congo River
            from Kinshasa to Brazzaville.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            Road travel

            Roads are not well maintained and are poorly lit. Some roads may become impassable
            during the rainy season. Road infrastructure is particularly damaged in the provinces
            surrounding Kinshasa, especially on the roads leading to Kikwit and Matadi, where you
            should travel in four-wheel-drive vehicles.

            Travel by road can be hazardous as drivers are aggressive.
            Official motorcades

            Presidential and other official motorcades pose hazards to motorists and pedestrians.
            Drivers should pull to the far side of the road when sirens or security forces announce
            their presence. You should not take photographs of motorcades or use communication
            devices that were not acquired or registered locally, including cellular phones and
            hand-held radios. Proceed only when security forces permit you to do so.
            General security information

            Tourist facilities are very limited in Kinshasa and almost non-existent outside the
            capital.

            If you are going to Kinshasa, ensure there is someone to meet you when you arrive at the
            airport.

            Communications by land phones and cellular phones are poor.

            Crime

            Petty crime (such as pickpocketing, luggage snatching and purse snatching) occurs in
            large cities and in tourist areas, on public transportation and in restaurants,
            particularly during the tourist seasons (summer months and winter holiday season).

            Pickpockets and purse snatchers may work in teams; one distracts the victim and another
            commits the robbery. Hotel lobbies and restaurants attract professional, well-dressed
            thieves who do not attract attention. Be vigilant and ensure your personal belongings
            are secure at all times.

            Canadians should be aware that gang-related violence can occur in Nørrebro, an area in
            the northern part of Copenhagen. Remain vigilant about your surroundings and avoid large
            unofficial gatherings.
            Terrorism

            The Danish Security and Intelligence Service maintains a public alert system on
            terrorism. Consult the website of the Danish Security and Intelligence Service for more
            information. On February 14, 2015, a gunman fired on a crowd in a café in Copenhagen,
            killing one person and injuring three police officers. Several hours later, a further
            shooting resulting in injuries was reported at a synagogue in central Copenhagen. Expect
            tighter security measures and increased police presence at high profile events or
            locations. Remain vigilant, keep informed of the current situation, monitor local media
            and follow the advice of local authorities.
            Public transportation

            Bus, train and taxi services are extensive.

            Ferry services, available for transport to Denmark’s many islands, may be disrupted
            during winter due to inclement weather.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            Cycling

            Cyclists are numerous in Danish cities and often have right-of-way over pedestrians and
            automobiles. In Copenhagen, bicycles may be rented for a small fee but cannot be taken
            out of the inner-city area.

            Motorists should be sure to check bicycle lanes before turning right, and pedestrians
            should watch carefully for bicycle traffic when crossing the street.
            Demonstrations

            Demonstrations occur periodically in larger urban centres. Although the demonstrations
            are usually peaceful, avoid them as a safety precaution.
            General safety measures

            Exercise normal safety precautions and avoid poorly lit areas at night.

            Ensure your personal belongings and passports and other travel documents are secure at
            all times.

            Terrorism

            Regional terror groups, including those associated with al Qaeda and al-Shabaab,
            continue to threaten Western interests and other potential targets in Djibouti. The
            September 21, 2013 attack on an upscale Nairobi mall illustrates the threat of attacks
            on civilians in East Africa. On May 24, 2014, an explosion in a restaurant frequented by
            foreigners killed three people and injured dozens. Further attacks cannot be ruled out.
            Be vigilant in crowded places and monitor local media.
            Crime

            Street crime is on the rise. Be vigilant in public places frequented by foreigners, such
            as hotels, restaurants, nightclubs and shopping areas. Do not show signs of affluence.
            Ensure that personal belongings, including passport and other travel documents, are
            secure at all times.
            Demonstrations

            Political demonstrations occur frequently. Avoid all gatherings and demonstrations as
            they can turn violent without warning. Monitor local news reports and follow the advice
            of local authorities.
            Road travel

            Drivers and pedestrians should exercise caution in the capital. Do not travel after
            dark. Streets are narrow, poorly maintained and lack adequate lighting. Local driving
            habits, pedestrians, roaming livestock and excessive speeds pose additional risks. Major
            roads are paved, but often lack guardrails. Police may set up roadblocks of wire coils,
            which may be difficult to see at night. Railway crossings are not well indicated. In the
            event of an accident, the driver should wait until the police arrive on the scene. You
            should contact the Embassy of Canada in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, the Consulate of Canada
            in Djibouti, or local authorities for the latest security information prior to overland
            travel.

            Since the operating gas stations are located at a considerable distance from one another
            (mostly in the cities of Djibouti, Ali Sabieh, Dikhil, Tadjourah and Obock), you should
            ensure you have sufficient fuel provisions in reserve before undertaking long drives.

            While Djibouti has been declared a “mine-safe” country, you should stay on paved roads,
            particularly in the northern districts of Tadjourah and Obock as well as the Ali Sabieh
            district in the south, where mines have been found in the past.
            Public transportation

            Intercity public travel is limited to bus and ferry services between Djibouti and the
            towns of Tadjourah and Obock. Buses are poorly maintained and driven erratically. Avoid
            travel by road or rail to Djibouti. There have been acts of sabotage and derailment on
            the Djibouti-Ethiopia railway.

            Piracy

            Pirate attacks occur in Djiboutian coastal waters, and in some cases, farther out at
            sea. Mariners should take appropriate precautions. Whenever possible, transit in
            trafficked sea-lanes. When sailing in and around the Horn of Africa, in the southern
            part of the Red Sea near the coasts of Yemen and in the Gulf of Aden, vessels should
            convoy in groups and maintain good communications at all times. The Yemeni Coast Guard
            24-hour Operations Centre can be contacted in case of emergency at 967-1562-402. For
            additional information, consult the Live Piracy Report published by the International
            Maritime Bureau.
            General safety information

            You should always carry identification, preferably a certified copy of your passport’s
            identification page. Avoid walking alone after dark. Because of their isolation, avoid
            visiting the beaches of Dorale and Khor Ambado late in the afternoon.

            Modern tourist facilities and communications networks are limited in the city of
            Djibouti and scarce in many outlying areas. Outside the capital, cell phone coverage is
            often unavailable.
        </item>
        <item>
            Crime

            Robberies and violent assaults have occurred near tourist facilities. Ensure that your
            personal belongings, passports and other travel documents are secure at all times. Avoid
            unpatrolled beaches and unpopulated areas, especially after dark. Check with local
            authorities to determine which beaches are safe.

            Do not carry large amounts of cash or wear jewellery.

            Petty crime increases during annual celebrations such as the Carnival in February and
            the Creole Music Festival in October.
            Road travel

            Traffic drives on the left. Roadside assistance is not widely available. Roads are
            narrow and steep with few guardrails. A lack of traffic signs, lane markings and
            warnings poses hazards. Roads outside the capital are unlit. Night driving should be
            undertaken with care. Road maps are essential. Car rentals are available. Purchase
            sufficient car insurance.
            Air travel

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            General safety information

            You should use a guide for mountain expeditions.

        <item>
            Demonstrations

            The security situation is stable. However, demonstrations and protests occasionally
            occur, particularly in the areas of Santiago, Salcedo, Bonao and Santo Domingo.
            Demonstrations are not targeted at foreigners and do not happen near all-inclusive
            resorts, although local travel outside resorts could be affected. Monitor local news
            reports and avoid all large gatherings and demonstrations as they may turn violent
            without warning.
            Crime

            Violent crime (including assault) against foreigners occasionally occurs. Petty crime
            (including pickpocketing) is common in urban areas. Thefts have been reported in
            resorts, including in hotel rooms and hotel room safes. Exercise caution and be aware of
            your surroundings, especially after dark. Avoid showing signs of affluence and do not
            leave your personal belongings unattended on the beach. Ensure that your personal
            belongings, passports and other travel documents are secure at all times. Limit the
            valuable items you bring into the country.

            Theft of items from checked baggage at airports has been reported. These thefts have
            taken place most frequently when travellers are departing. Money and personal items have
            also been stolen from carry-on luggage while travellers are going through security
            checks. Do not pack valuables in your checked luggage. Items most likely to disappear
            include electronics (especially digital cameras), jewellery and perfume. All bags are
            routinely X-rayed upon arrival and departure.

            In the event that documents are lost or stolen, obtain a police report in order to
            receive a passport or an appropriate travel document from the Embassy of Canada in Santo
            Domingo, the Consulate of Canada in Puerto Plata or the Office of the Embassy of Canada
            in Punta Cana.

            Unaccompanied female travellers should exercise caution in dealing with strangers or
            recent acquaintances, especially regarding the acceptance of rides or other invitations.
            Incidents of assault, rape and sexual aggression against foreigners have been reported,
            including at beach resorts. In some cases, hotel employees have been implicated.

            Never leave food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers. Be wary of accepting
            snacks, beverages, gum, or cigarettes from new acquaintances, as they may contain drugs
            that could put you at risk of sexual assault and robbery. Anyone who is a victim of
            sexual assault or other crime should report the crime immediately. No criminal
            investigation is possible without a formal complaint to the Dominican authorities.
            Road travel

            The Dominican Republic has one of the highest road accident rates in the world. Driving
            is hazardous due to aggressive driving habits, a significant number of trucks and
            motorcycles, reckless passing, excessive speeds, poorly marked lanes, construction,
            vehicles travelling in the wrong direction on one-way streets, and poorly maintained
            roads and cars. Driving after dark is not recommended due to poor lighting.

            Traffic laws are similar to those in Canada but are often not respected. There have been
            reports of police officers, or criminals posing as police officers, demanding immediate
            payment of traffic fines. Drivers should insist on paying any traffic fine at the
            nearest police station. Pedestrians should take extra care.

            In the event of a vehicle breakdown or roadside emergency, a highway patrol service
            sponsored by the Ministry of Public Works and staffed by police officers and military
            personnel provides free 24-hour assistance on all major toll highways. In case of an
            emergency, dial 1-829-688-1000 for assistance.
            Public transportation

            Public transportation is not recommended. Private companies operate reliable buses
            between cities. Taxi-plane services are also available.

            Taxis are fairly reliable. You should always negotiate the fare prior to departure.
            Avoid using or renting motorcycle taxis (motoconchos), as they are very dangerous. Route
            taxis (gua-guas/carros publicos) are not recommended as they may disregard traffic laws,
            often resulting in serious accidents involving injury and sometimes death. They may also
            be used by thieves to rob passengers.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            Fraud

            Credit card and debit card fraud occurs. Pay careful attention when your cards are being
            handled by others during payment. Be cautious when using automated banking machines, and
            only do so to withdraw money during business hours inside a bank.
            General security information

            Water safety standards may not be comparable to Canadian safety standards. Hotels and
            resorts may not have lifeguards on beaches, and appropriate safety and rescue equipment
            may not be available. It is imperative that you keep informed of local water conditions
            and warning systems (including at your hotel) and follow instructions accordingly.
            Strong undertows could pose threats, especially in the Macao area. Swimmers who enter
            the water do so at their own risk. Remain in well-marked and supervised areas. Avoid
            walking on deserted or unsupervised beaches after dark.

            It is also possible that aquatic equipment offered at the beach does not meet Canadian
            safety standards. Check that your travel insurance covers accidents related to
            recreational activities. Avoid participating in any water activities under the influence
            of alcohol or other substances.

            Avoid excursions that are not recommended by tour operators. Ensure that tour operators
            have taken proper safety measures, including the use of safety equipment such as helmets
            and life jackets, before undertaking extreme or eco-tourism types of activities.

            A number of cases have been reported of Canadians losing large sums of money while
            playing progressive keno, super keno and other keno or progressive roulette games at
            casinos. These games operate on a progressive wagering basis, and large amounts of money
            can be lost rapidly. Exercise caution in hotel casinos where these games are offered,
            especially when requested to provide credit card information.
            Emergency services

            The tourist police (POLITUR), a cooperative effort between the national police,
            secretary of the armed forces and the secretary of tourism, provide a security presence
            in tourist areas and first response assistance to tourists. They can be reached
            toll-free at 1-809-200-3500 and can help get tourists to a police station to file a
            report and to seek further assistance.

            Dial 911 for emergency services in Santo Domingo.
        </item>
        <item>
            Areas immediately bordering Colombia (see Advisory)

            Travel to and within areas immediately bordering Colombia is dangerous due to the
            presence of drug traffickers and criminal organizations and the risk of violence,
            kidnappings, armed assaults and extortion. There have been reports of Canadian,
            American, British and Australian tourists and foreign oil workers being kidnapped in
            these areas. Armed robberies have also been reported at jungle lodges in the areas of
            Lower Rio Napo and Cuyabeno National Reserve.

            Curfews and states of emergency may be declared in regions affected by civil unrest,
            natural disaster or other disruption. During a state of emergency, authorities have
            expanded powers to restore order, including suspension of some constitutional rights and
            expanded detention powers.
            Petty crime

            Street crimes, including purse snatching, car break-ins, thefts, pickpocketing and
            violent carjackings, are daily occurrences in major cities. Thieves often work in teams,
            in which one thief diverts the victims’ attention while the other snatches their
            possessions. Groups of street children who sell candy are often engaged in this type of
            team operation. Luggage theft is common at airports, bus terminals, on buses (city and
            regional) and at other transit points. Thefts of backpacks and other small bags are also
            very common on buses, even when the individual is being careful. Thieves can be very
            creative, such as cutting the purse or bag when you have it between your feet or
            spilling something on you in order to distract you.

            In urban centres, thieves target cars stopped in traffic for break-ins. Hide your
            valuables and be aware of your surroundings when driving. The hotel zones in Quito are
            often targeted by thieves and muggers who believe tourists are affluent. Remain aware of
            your surroundings at all times and maintain a low profile when walking in these areas.
            Avoid walking alone—women especially—and avoid travelling after dark.

            Carry only small amounts of money. Do not show signs of affluence and keep all valuable
            items and electronic equipment out of sight. Ensure that your personal belongings,
            passports and other travel documents are secure at all times, and carry colour
            photocopies of your identification documents.

            Armed robberies are frequent. In case of robbery, remain calm and do not resist.
            Exercise caution and be attentive to your surroundings when using automated banking
            machines (ABMs). Use only ABMs in well-lit public areas where there are lots of people,
            such as malls or in banks, and do so only during daylight hours.
            Assault

            Sexual assaults against tourists are reported regularly throughout the country. Always
            exercise caution, avoid isolated areas and travel in groups.

            Never leave food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers. Be wary of accepting
            snacks, beverages, gum or cigarettes from new acquaintances, as the items may contain
            drugs that could put you at risk of sexual assault and robbery. Incidents can occur in
            various locations, including buses, nightclubs and bars.

            Sexual assaults and armed robberies have been reported in the area of the Pichincha
            volcano. Do not walk outside the limits of the Quito Teleférico or its pathway, and
            avoid hiking to the antennas of the volcano via Cruz Loma, west of Quito.

            Robberies at gunpoint have also been reported along the hiking trail up Cerro Mandango
            near Vilcabamba, Loja. Those robbed, who are often foreigners, report being accosted by
            a group of masked, armed men while hiking along the trail. Thieves have resorted to
            undoing or opening articles of clothing to locate valuables and personal items to steal.

            Armed assaults can occur in public parks in and around transportation terminals,
            especially in Guayaquil, Quito, Manta and Cuenca. In Quito, exercise caution in the
            areas of El Panecillo, Carolina Park, Guápulo, Old Quito, South Quito and particularly
            the popular tourist sector of Mariscal Sucre, where sexual assaults have occurred. Avoid
            walking up to the Panecillo.

            In Guayaquil, remain vigilant when visiting the downtown area, the waterfront (El
            Malecón), the market area and the Sagrado Corazón de Jesús (statue of Jesus Christ) on
            Cerro del Carmen. Avoid wandering on deserted beaches, especially at night. Random
            attacks at gunpoint, robberies and sexual assaults involving Canadians have occurred in
            the Riobamba area.

            Armed robberies on beaches occur throughout the country, especially in the province of
            Esmeraldas. Robberies have been carried out during the day and have even targeted large
            groups of tourists.
            Kidnapping

            Kidnapping for ransom and express kidnappings, often in connection with carjackings, is
            a concern throughout Ecuador but is of particular concern in Guayaquil. To address the
            problem, the Ecuadorian government has installed cameras and panic buttons in taxis. The
            panic button is linked directly to 911, and as soon as you press the button, someone
            will be able to watch, live, what is happening in the taxi.

            Express kidnappings involve the brief detention of an individual, who is released only
            after being forced to withdraw funds from an ABM or after arranging for family or
            friends to pay a ransom. Exercise caution when using taxis, as taxi drivers have
            reportedly carried out express kidnappings. You should always use reputable radio taxi
            companies, booked in advance, if possible.
            Civil unrest

            Public transportation is often disrupted during demonstrations. Protesters may burn
            tires, throw rocks and Molotov cocktails, engage in the destruction of private and
            public property and detonate small improvised explosive devices during demonstrations.
            Police response may include the use of water cannons and tear gas. Avoid areas where
            demonstrations are in progress and be prepared with alternate travel arrangements.
            Although political demonstrations have not been directed at foreigners in the past,
            peaceful demonstrations can become violent with little or no warning. Foreigners are
            prohibited from protesting in Ecuador and may be subject to arrest for participating in
            any demonstration.

            Strikes and disturbances by local fishermen in the Galápagos Islands sometimes affect
            the movement of tourists and prevent access to some sites. If you are planning to travel
            to the Galápagos Islands, obtain written confirmation from your travel agent or tour
            operator that your tour vessel is certified by the Ecuadorian navy (Armada del Ecuador)
            to meet the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea or SOLAS standards.
            Road travel

            Though road conditions have improved, road travel is slow due to unmarked speed bumps,
            large pot holes, traffic lights on major highways, heavy traffic (especially on weekends
            and statutory holidays) and police and military road blocks. Heavy rain and mudslides
            often close or wash out roads. Heavy fog occasionally poses hazards in mountainous
            areas.

            Driving in Ecuador is hazardous and unpredictable. There are all types of vehicles on
            the road that do not meet acceptable safety standards. Drivers involved in accidents
            causing physical injury are immediately detained. In many cases, detention lasts until
            responsibility for the accident has been assigned and all parties are satisfied.

            Robberies and assaults continue to be reported regularly on intercity and urban
            Guayaquil buses, especially after dark. Bus drivers often make illegal stops to pick up
            passengers on express routes, especially on the routes between Guayaquil and Cuenca and
            between Guayaquil and Riobamba. The Ecuadorian government has installed GPS units on
            buses to track their routes, where they stop and for how long, in an effort to improve
            security. Avoid travelling after dark.

            Only use registered taxis, identified by orange licence plates and an orange and white
            registration number on the side of the car and on the windshield. Do not hail taxis on
            the street.

            Marine travel

            There is a risk of attack and armed robbery against ships in Ecuadorian waters.
            Air travel

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            General safety information

            If you intend to trek:

            a) never trek alone;
            b) always hire an experienced guide and ensure that the trekking company is reputable;
            c) buy travel health insurance that includes helicopter rescue and medical evacuation;
            d) ensure that you are in top physical condition;
            e) advise a family member or friend of your itinerary;
            f) know the symptoms of acute altitude sickness, which can be fatal;
            g) register with the Embassy of Canada in Ecuador; and
            h) obtain detailed information on trekking routes before setting out.

            Your insurance should include provision for helicopter rescue, medical evacuation and
            treatment for accidental injury and medical emergencies.

            The emergency number for police, fire and rescue is 911. In case of robbery, assault,
            fraud or loss of belongings in Quito, you may contact the “tourist police”, a specially
            designated police unit, at (593 2) 254-3983.

            The Ministry of Tourism has developed an app that can be installed on a smartphone of
            any traveller visiting Ecuador. It is available in English and allows you to ask for
            help in the case of an emergency and to be located through your phone’s GPS. To install
            the app visit: http://www.ecu911.gob.ec/aplicacionparacelulares/.

            The Ministry of Tourism has a tourist service complaints management system e-mail:
            denuncias@turismo.gob.ec and their toll free number is 1-800-turismo (8874766).

            Seek advice from local authorities before swimming, as strong currents, undertow and
            underwater hazards may exist and are not always posted. Most beaches lack consistently
            staffed lifeguard stations.
            Fraud

            Credit card fraud is increasing in Ecuador. Credit card magnetic strips have been
            duplicated, particularly at restaurants and bars where swiping your own card may not
            always be possible. Pay careful attention when your cards are being handled by others.
            Scams involving debit cards also occur. Carefully inspect ABMs before using to ensure
            that they have not been tampered with.

            Sinai Peninsula (except coastal resorts, such as Sharm El-Sheikh) (see Advisory)

            Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development Canada advises against all travel to the Sinai
            Peninsula, with the exception of the coastal resorts, such as Sharm El-Sheikh, where you
            should exercise caution.

            The security situation in the Sinai in the areas bordering Israel and the Gaza Strip
            remains extremely dangerous as the Egyptian military is currently engaged in military
            operations against terrorists in the region. A three-month state of emergency has been
            declared in the Sinai Peninsula on October 24, 2014. A 5 p.m. to 7 a.m. curfew is in
            place. Road blockades by unsanctioned groups as well as kidnappings, robberies and
            carjackings by armed groups and terrorists have been reported in many areas of the
            Sinai. You are discouraged from visiting St. Catherine’s Monastery or taking any other
            day trips from Sharm El-Sheikh as attacks and roadblocks have occurred outside of Sharm
            El-Sheikh city limits.
            Western Desert (see Advisory)

            Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development Canada advises against non-essential travel to
            the Western Desert, including Siwa, Farafra, Dahkla, Bawati/Bahariya, and the White and
            Black deserts.

            On July 19, 2014, an armed group attacked a security checkpoint along the Farafra-Bawati
            road in the New Valley Governate, killing 22 security forces officers. This was the
            second attack on this checkpoint. On June 1, 2014, an attack killed one officer and five
            conscripts from the same security unit. On May 31, 2014, six patrolling Egyptian
            soldiers were killed in the western desert area of Al-Wahat.

            If you intend to travel to the southwest area of Egypt bordering Sudan and Libya, you
            will be required to apply for a permit from the Travel Permits Department at the
            Egyptian Ministry of the Interior. You should consider the risks to your personal safety
            and ensure you have made appropriate security arrangements. The border areas are porous,
            and bandits and armed groups are known to be active.
            Sinai Peninsula coastal resorts, including Sharm El-Sheikh

            On May 2, 2014, two bomb blasts in El Tor (At Tur) left several people dead and injured.
            On February 16, 2014, a bomb exploded on a tourist bus in Taba, located approximately
            three hours by vehicle from Sharm El-Sheikh, killing four people and injuring several
            others. Terrorist groups may target further areas in South Sinai, including coastal
            resorts such as Sharm El-Sheikh. While there are enhanced security measures in place to
            protect the tourism infrastructure in Sharm El-Sheikh, the area may be seen as a
            high-value target by terrorists. Be aware of your surroundings at all times and follow
            the advice of local authorities.

            Coastal resorts in the Sinai, including Sharm El-Sheikh, Dahab and Nuweiba have, in the
            past, seen incidents of robbery. Tensions between security authorities and local Bedouin
            tribes may rise unexpectedly, affecting tourism.

            If you are visiting Sharm El-Sheikh you are strongly discouraged from using any other
            means of transportation besides air travel to arrive and depart.
            Red Sea and Upper Egypt coastal resorts

            Exercise a high degree of caution when travelling to Red Sea coastal resorts such as
            Hurghada and to the Upper Egypt cities of Luxor and Aswan.

            Pay particular attention to local conditions if you are visiting Upper Egypt and the
            historic sites of the Nile Valley. Although tourist sites continue to operate, the Upper
            Nile Valley between Beni Suef and Aswan has seen a greater incidence of strikes, road
            blockages and civil unrest than the coastal resorts. Feuds between clans, some with a
            religious aspect, are becoming more commonplace and can turn violent quickly. You may
            find yourself in the wrong place at the wrong time. Travel in large groups and by
            organized transportation, and follow the advice of local authorities, hotels and tour
            guides if you are travelling to rural areas.
            Civil Unrest

            Civil unrest and demonstrations have been occurring in many parts of Egypt. Although
            demonstrations occur mostly on Fridays following the Noon prayer time, they can occur at
            any time without forewarning. The situation on the ground remains fluid and there is a
            potential for rapid escalation into violence where large groups of people are assembled.
            Local curfews may be imposed on short notice.

            Although the state of emergency and curfew, imposed in August 2013, were lifted on
            November 12, 2013, armed security forces remain heavily deployed in many governorates.

            While there is a heavy security presence in most parts of the country, especially in
            resort areas, a high threat of terrorist activities remains and could affect foreigners.

            Be extremely vigilant, avoid all demonstrations or large gatherings and areas where they
            are taking place. Stay clear of military offices and facilities. Register with our
            Registration of Canadians Abroad service, keep well informed of the situation as it
            unfolds by monitoring local news reports and follow the advice of local authorities.
            Women in particular should avoid demonstrations and large gatherings as there have been
            multiple reports of sexual assaults. Once surrounded by a group, it can be difficult to
            escape.
            Terrorism

            Egyptian Security Forces in the Sinai are on alert due to the ongoing threat of
            terrorist attacks. Attacks in Egypt, including in the capital Cairo, could be
            indiscriminate and could occur with little to no warning. There is an increased risk of
            attacks on and around January 25, the anniversary of the Egyptian Revolution. You should
            restrict your movements during this period. While attacks have mainly been aimed at
            security forces, their facilities and other government buildings, attacks targeting
            foreigners cannot be ruled out.

            An increase in the number of attacks using improvised explosive devices has occurred
            since January 2015 throughout the country, particularly in the greater Cairo area.

            On September 21, 2014, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) released a
            statement threatening retaliation for the American -led coalition campaign against ISIL
            in Iraq and Syria. The statement encouraged opportunistic and indiscriminate attacks
            against citizens and interests of countries supporting the coalition, including
            Canadians. Individuals and terrorist groups in the region may be inspired to carry out
            attacks in a show of solidarity with ISIL. Canadians could also be targeted by a
            terrorist attack and be considered kidnapping targets. Areas frequented by foreigners
            may be targeted. Such places include restaurants, shopping centers, markets, hotels,
            schools, embassies and transportation hubs. Exercise a high degree of personal security
            awareness at all times, maintain a heightened level of vigilance and be aware of your
            surroundings at all times.

            Most recent attacks include: A bomb exploded outside Cairo University on October 22,
            2014, injuring six police officers and four civilians. This is the second such incident
            in the university’s vicinity in the past six months. On September 21, 2014, an explosion
            in Cairo near the Egyptian Ministry of Foreign Affairs killed one passer-by and two
            police officers and injured several others. On June 30, 2014, three bombs exploded near
            the presidential palace in Cairo, killing two police officers and injuring 10 people. In
            the past, terrorist attacks have occurred at tourist locations and elsewhere throughout
            the country. The threat of more attacks remains, and there is a risk of being in the
            wrong place at the wrong time.

            Exercise a high degree of caution, monitor developments and exercise caution, especially
            in commercial establishments, government facilities, public areas, tourist sites, the
            vicinity of churches and mosques at the time of religious services, and other areas
            frequented by foreigners. You should particularly avoid police stations, security
            installations and government buildings, as well as all crowds and demonstrations.
            Crime

            Serious crimes have been on the increase in Egypt in the wake of the January 2011
            unrest. In addition to the increased threat of kidnapping (see above), carjackings have
            become much more commonplace. Sports utility vehicles are typically targeted. Although
            isolated areas and night driving present the greatest threat, there have been reported
            incidents in daylight hours and in busy areas of Cairo. Assailants are likely armed, and
            a variety of tactics may be used to get vehicles to stop, including throwing objects at
            the windshield, feigning a traffic accident or a minor collision with the target
            vehicle, or “sandwiching” the target vehicle and forcing it off the road. If you find
            yourself in such a situation, do not resist as carjackers are typically after the
            vehicle and, if the carjacking is successful, will leave the driver unharmed.

            Petty crime such as purse snatching and pickpocketing occurs, especially in tourist
            locations and on the metro. Anecdotal evidence suggests that crime is increasing,
            particularly property crime such as theft and robbery. Ensure personal belongings are
            secure and respect any advice or instructions from local security authorities.

            If you are a victim of crime, report it to the Tourist Police or at any nearby police
            station as soon as possible. Request a copy of the police report at the time the report
            is made. Failure to report the crime while in Egypt makes it much more difficult to seek
            prosecution.
            Women\'s safety

            Women, particularly foreign women, are frequently subject to unpleasant male attention,
            sexual harassment and verbal abuse. This often takes the form of staring, inappropriate
            remarks, catcalls and touching. Please consult our publication entitled Her Own Way: A
            Woman’s Guide to Safe and Successful Travel for more information.
            Landmines

            Unexploded landmines remain a risk in some desert and coastal areas, notably the
            Mediterranean shore, the Western Desert, the Sinai Peninsula and the western shore of
            the Gulf of Suez. Known minefields are not marked by signs, but may be enclosed by
            barbed wire. Seek local advice, especially if travelling off-road.
            Transportation

            Road conditions are often poor and the rate of vehicular accidents is one of the highest
            in the world. Drivers generally have little regard for traffic regulations and do not
            follow safe-driving practices. Be cautious when crossing streets as drivers do not give
            pedestrians the right of way. In the event of an accident, do not move the vehicle until
            the police arrive.

            Use vehicles and drivers from reputable travel agencies.

            Avoid microbuses because of hazardous driving habits.

            Taxis and the metro are considered the safest means of travel. Most taxis do not have
            working meters, and back seats are rarely equipped with seat belts. Women should not sit
            in the front seat, as this could be misinterpreted by the driver.

            Rail travel is generally safe between Alexandria and Cairo; however, safety standards
            vary throughout the rest of Egypt. In the past, protesters have blocked railways,
            causing deadly accidents. Exercise a high degree of caution.

            Accidents have occurred on ferries because of overcrowding and poor safety standards.
            Use reputable ferry operators.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            Scuba diving / aquatic activities

            Sharks are present in the waters off Egypt. Certain beaches and dive areas may be
            subject to temporary closures. The Egyptian Chamber of Diving and Water Sports provides
            updates on closures and diving conditions in Egypt. Exercise caution and seek advice
            from local authorities.
            Borders

            Crossing the border between Egypt and Israel is strongly discouraged at this time. The
            status of all crossing points can be verified prior to arrival with the Egyptian Embassy
            in Israel or the Israeli Embassy in Egypt. Cross-border movement regulations and
            restrictions are subject to change at any time and are the prerogative of the
            responsible authorities.

            The Rafah border crossing point to Gaza, which had been closed since June 2007, was
            reopened in May 2011. However, the border has been subject to sporadic closures since
            then. The entry and exit of people remain controlled by border authorities in both Egypt
            and Gaza. Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development Canada advises against all travel in
            this area due to ongoing military operations against terrorists. Consult local
            authorities and refer to the travel advice for Israel, the West Bank, and the Gaza Strip
            for further information.

            Beyond the provision of a travel document (the passport), the Canadian government does
            not facilitate the crossing of borders by private citizens. It is the citizen\'s
            responsibility to meet the entry requirements of the country where they wish to travel,
            in most cases either through application for a visa or simply by going to a point of
            entry. Authorities at the Rafah border crossing from Egypt to Gaza have sometimes
            requested a letter or witnessed declaration from the Canadian Embassy as a requirement
            to cross the border. The Embassy is unable to provide such letters given the foregoing
            and you should avoid all travel to Gaza. The Canadian government has very limited
            ability to provide consular services to Canadians in the Gaza Strip and once in Gaza it
            can be difficult to leave.
            General safety information

            Although most tourist sites are open, the situation across Egypt remains unpredictable
            and less consistently safe than it was before the events of January 2011. There is a
            potential for rapid escalation into violence where large groups of people are assembled.

            Egypt has a special police force to assist tourists. Officers, who wear a distinctive
            arm band saying “Tourist and Antiquities Police”, can be found in hotels and at tourist
            sites.

            Carry identification at all times. Photocopy your passport and other identification in
            case of loss or seizure.
            Emergency services

            Dial 122 for police.

            Crime

            Violent crime such as homicide, armed robbery, carjacking, rape and kidnapping is common
            throughout the country.

            Although most Canadians visiting El Salvador encounter no safety or security problems,
            the criminal threat in El Salvador is real. Robberies often occur on public
            transportation and in tourist areas. Violent, organized gangs (“maras”) are often behind
            extortion attempts and have been known to use grenades to enforce their demands. Attacks
            have occurred in open-air markets, restaurants, police stations, public buses and
            clinics. The attacks are unpredictable and often harm or kill innocent bystanders.

            Robberies and express kidnappings by “moto ratas” are on the rise and can occur day or
            night. Victims, generally selected on the basis of perceived wealth (including
            late-model cars), are identified at such places as shopping centres, gas stations,
            restaurants, night clubs, banks and parking lots. One or two robbers, riding on
            motorcycles, follow their victims and stop them at gunpoint. In most cases, victims are
            taken to automated banking machines (ABMs) and forced to withdraw the highest amount
            possible. Carjackings also occur. There are occasionally reports of armed criminals
            following travellers from the airport to private residences or secluded stretches of
            road, where they carry out assaults or robberies. Criminals can become violent and shoot
            if victims do not cooperate immediately.

            Homicides frequently occur on public buses, roads, soccer fields and farms, as well as
            in private residences.

            Remain discreet and vigilant at all times. Avoid displaying signs of affluence in
            public. Travel in groups. Avoid travelling after dark, including in the capital city of
            San Salvador. Hotels in the neighbourhoods of Escalón and San Benito, in San Salvadore,
            are generally safe. Ensure that your personal belongings, passports and other travel
            documents are secure at all times. Carry only a copy of the identification page of your
            passport and sufficient funds for the day, and exercise extreme caution when using ABMs.
            If you are threatened by robbers, stay calm and cooperate.

            Be especially cautious in the departments of La Libertad, La Paz, La Union, Santa Ana,
            San Miguel, San Salvador, San Vicente, and Sonsonate, which have the highest homicide
            rates in El Salvador.

            The historic downtown of San Salvador (especially from Parque Simón Bolivar to Plaza El
            Zurita, and from Alameda Juan Pablo II to Boulevard Venezuela), can be dangerous as
            criminals often hide in crowds and attack without warning. Gangs and individuals who
            specialize in muggings, extortion and murder operate in these areas.

            Neighbourhoods of San Salvador that should be avoided if possible since they pose the
            highest risk to travellers are Soyapango, Apopa, Nejapa, Ilopango, Tutunichapa. The
            regions bordering Guatemala can be dangerous because of drug turf wars. While Canadians
            are not specifically targeted, there is a risk of being in the wrong place at the wrong
            time.

            Attacks and robberies have been reported at border crossings, particularly on the
            Guatemala side. As the Las Chinamas crossing is particularly hazardous, use one of the
            other three border crossings (La Hachadura, San Cristóbal or Anguiatú) if possible.
            Armed robbers have been known to dress as Guatemalan police and to erect roadblocks to
            stop buses with Salvadoran licence plates heading into Guatemala. They then rob the
            driver and passengers. When crossing the border with Guatemala, drive with car doors
            locked, do not stop for street or roadside vendors, and avoid travelling after dark.
            Demonstrations

            Demonstrations, sit-ins and protests may occur at any time or place, especially in the
            capital city, on its main access roads and, in particular, around the Salvador del Mundo
            monument (Plaza Las Americas). Avoid large gatherings or demonstrations, and follow
            local media reports.
            Road travel

            Overloaded vehicles and mechanical problems are common. Streets tend to be narrow,
            poorly signed and crowded with street vendors. Salvadoran authorities will arrest or
            detain drivers involved in accidents resulting in injury or death until responsibility
            for the accident has been established in court.

            Drive with car doors locked and windows closed, and avoid driving after dark. There is
            always a risk of banditry, carjacking, kidnapping and criminal assault on rural roads.
            Due to the lack of police and roadside assistance services, travel in convoy when not on
            major highways. Rural areas may be accessible only by four-wheel-drive vehicle.

            While most land borders remain open 24 hours a day, some have been known to close
            without warning. Cross early enough to ensure that you will arrive at your destination
            before dark. Do not exchange any type of currency with informal money changers at land
            borders as doing so has led to robbery.
            Public transportation

            Use only reputable tour operators. Do not use local or intercity public buses as
            vehicles are often mechanically unreliable and passengers are frequently robbed, often
            at knife- or gunpoint. Grenade attacks have also been reported on public transit.

            Taxis are widely available. Use a reliable company recommended by a major hotel chain
            and negotiate fares in advance. Tipping is not expected.
            Air transportation

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            Hiking

            Tourists have been robbed while climbing volcanoes and hiking in remote locations.
            Travel only with reputable tourist organizations or persons familiar with local
            conditions. Ensure personal belongings and travel documents are secure at all times.
            General safety information

            Strong currents and undertow make swimming in the Pacific Ocean risky. Always exercise
            caution as beaches have few, or no, lifeguards. Avoid isolated beaches.

            Cellular phone service is generally reliable. Cellular phones are available locally for
            a modest sum at any retail kiosk for a major telephone company. These phones provide the
            added advantage of having a local number for emergencies.
            Emergency services

            Dial 911 for local police, and 503-2264-7911 to reach Priority, the most reliable
            ambulance service in the country.

            Crime

            Although the crime rate is lower than that of other countries in the region, petty crime
            and corruption do occur, particularly in Bata and Malabo. Armed robberies and muggings
            involving foreigners have increased in Malabo. Avoid walking alone after dark and avoid
            groups of young men congregated near bars and restaurants.
            Demonstrations

            Maintain a high level of security awareness at all times and avoid public gatherings and
            street demonstrations. Ensure that personal belongings, passport and other travel
            documents are secure at all times.
            Road travel

            Most roads in Equatorial Guinea are paved and traffic signs are adequate. Excessive
            speeds, increased traffic, and driving habits pose risks. Avoid travel after dark. Do
            not pick up hitchhikers. In the event of an accident, you should not move your vehicle
            until the police arrive. Minibuses and taxis are available throughout the country. Car
            rental companies also exist.
            Piracy

            Pirate attacks occur in coastal waters and, in some cases, farther out at sea. Mariners
            should take appropriate precautions. For additional information, consult the Live Piracy
            Report published by the International Maritime Bureau.
            General security information

            Police and military checks and roadblocks are common. If you are stopped for a small
            traffic violation, cooperate with local authorities and request a citation, to be paid
            at the local court.

            When travelling outside of Bata and Malabo, we recommend that you carry a letter from
            your employer or other organization stating the purpose of your travel. Proper
            identification must be carried at all times. Failure to do so may result in detention.
            You should contact local authorities before travelling outside the main cities. A
            security permit issued by the government is required to visit the Bioko Island
            destinations of Pico Basile, Moka and Ureca.

            On February 17, 2009, an attack occurred near the presidential palace in Malabo.
            Military personnel were deployed throughout the city to ensure general security.
            Airports and seaports were closed for a few hours. Although such incidents are not
            common, you are advised to remain vigilant, monitor local news reports and follow the
            advice of authorities.
            Emergency services

            In case of emergency, dial 113 for the police and 115 for fire emergencies. For
            ambulance services, call La Paz Medical Clinic Bata: 333 083403/333 083501 or La Paz
            Medical Clinic Malabo: 55 6666 153.

            Border between Eritrea and Ethiopia (see Advisory)

            You should avoid all travel to the border area between Eritrea and Ethiopia, which
            extends 25 kilometres north into Eritrea. Political tension remains high between these
            two countries due to a long-standing territorial conflict. The border is not clearly
            defined, and border checkpoints remain closed. Military operations may resume in
            adjoining areas, which constitute a special security zone under a cessation of
            hostilities agreement. Violent incidents could still occur. Also note the existence of
            unmarked landmines in these areas. We strongly advise against driving off main and paved
            roads.
            Border between Eritrea and Sudan (see Advisory)

            You should avoid all travel to the border area between Eritrea and Sudan, due to
            continuing instability in eastern Sudan and the risks posed by active Islamic extremist
            groups. Crime and bomb attacks are often reported. The Sudanese border remains closed,
            and we strongly advise against attempting to cross it.
            Border between Eritrea and Djibouti (see Advisory)

            You should avoid all travel to the border areas of Eritrea and Djibouti, where political
            tension and territorial conflicts continue to cause instability. Border raids could
            still be carried out, resulting in armed confrontations and other violent incidents.
            Crime is also reported in this area.
            Terrorism

            Regional terror groups, including those associated with al Qaeda and al-Shabaab,
            continue to threaten Western interests and other potential targets in Eritrea. The
            September 21, 2013 attack on an upscale Nairobi mall illustrates the threat of attacks
            on civilians in East Africa. Further attacks cannot be ruled out. Be vigilant in crowded
            places and monitor local media.
            Crime

            Street crime, including petty theft and robbery, is infrequent in Asmara and in other
            towns and villages. However, there has been an increase in pickpocketing and harassment
            against foreigners. You should take the usual security precautions and avoid showing
            signs of affluence.

            Banditry occurs along the coast north of Massawa.
            Demonstrations

            Demonstrations and rallies occur in Eritrea and have the potential to suddenly turn
            violent. They can lead to significant disruptions to traffic and public transportation.
            Avoid all demonstrations and large gatherings, follow the advice of local authorities
            and monitor local media.
            Landmines

            Landmines continue to cause occasional injury and death. Many areas are mined. Caution
            must be exercised when travelling in remote areas or off main roads. Avoid walking and
            hiking in the countryside.

            Contact the Consulate of Canada in Asmara or local authorities to obtain the latest
            safety and travel information.
            Piracy

            Pirate attacks occur in coastal waters and, in some cases, farther out at sea. Mariners
            should take appropriate precautions. For additional information, consult the Live Piracy
            Report published by the International Maritime Bureau.
            Telecommunications

            Landline telephone and cell phone networks are unreliable and often limited to a few
            hours of service a day in major cities.
            Road travel

            Avoid travelling in rural areas after nightfall. Paved roads connect the major cities of
            Asmara, Massawa, Mendefera, Dekemhare, Barentou and Keren, but roads to small villages
            are unpaved. Road signs and safety guard rails are often non‑existent. There are risks
            involved in driving, owing to the presence on the road of animals and numerous
            pedestrians and cyclists.
            Public transportation

            Public conveyances, especially buses, are often overcrowded. Many taxis are available,
            but they often take several passengers and follow predetermined itineraries. If you pay
            a higher fare, you may ask a driver in advance not to take other passengers.
            General safety information

            Consult our Transportation FAQ in order to verify if national airlines meet safety
            standards.

            Crime

            Violent crime occurs, but foreigners are not usually targeted. Petty crime (e.g.
            pickpocketing, purse snatching and mugging) also occurs, particularly in Tallinn’s Old
            Town during the summer tourist season. Thieves often work in small groups and target
            tourists in airports, train stations and other public areas. Avoid parks, poorly lit
            streets and certain areas of Tallinn after dark, including Kopli and Lasnamäe.

            Theft of vehicles or their contents is common. Keep vehicles locked and in guarded
            parking lots overnight.
            Road safety

            Road travel can be hazardous because of aggressive drivers, disregarded traffic laws,
            poorly lit country roads and wandering animals. Driving can be especially dangerous in
            winter, when roads are icy and snow covered.

            The Estonian Traffic Act requires that all pedestrians wear small reflectors at night.
            The reflectors can be purchased at most stores and are usually pinned to coats or bags.
            The law is most enforced in rural areas, where lack of lighting makes it difficult for
            drivers to see pedestrians. Failure to wear a reflector may result in a fine of €40 and,
            in the case of multiple offences or if the offender is under the influence of alcohol,
            up to €400.
            Demonstrations

            Demonstrations are rare but should be avoided, as all demonstrations and large
            gatherings can suddenly turn violent. Follow the advice of local authorities and monitor
            local media.
            Public transportation

            Use only officially marked taxis and make sure that the taxi meter is in use and that
            prices are posted. Order a taxi rather than hail one from the street. The taxi companies
            Tulika Takso, Linnatakso and Tallink Takso are able to confirm the type, number and
            colour of the car when you order.

            City buses are reliable but often crowded. Rail service is usually good but is limited
            to local connections around the main cities in Estonia.

            Bus, plane and ferry services to neighbouring countries operate frequently. Relatively
            good highways connect Estonia with Latvia and Russia.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            Fraud

            Credit card and debit card fraud occurs. Pay careful attention when your cards are being
            handled by others during payment processing.

            Internet frauds such as dating and financial scams occur.

            See Overseas Fraud for more information on scams abroad.
            General safety measures

            Carry adequate identification at all times. Keep a photocopy of your passport in case of
            loss or seizure.

            Exercise normal security precautions. Do not show signs of affluence. Ensure that
            personal belongings and passports and other travel documents are secure at all times.
            Emergency services

            Border with Eritrea, including the Danakil Desert (see Advisory)

            You are advised against all travel within 10 km of the Eritrean border in the Tigray and
            Afar regions. The border between Eritrea and Ethiopia is closed due to recurring
            military tensions and an unsettled border dispute, as demonstrated on March 15, 2012
            when the Ethiopian military attacked targets in Eritrea. Adjacent areas are part of a
            special and heavily militarized security corridor where armed conflict could erupt. The
            security situation is particularly unpredictable in the northern regions of Tigray and
            Afar. Banditry and the threat of kidnapping are also a concern.

            There is an ongoing threat of armed assaults and kidnappings against tourists and
            convoys in the Danakil Desert (northern Afar region). In January 2012, a group of
            foreign tourists was attacked by gunmen approximately 30 kilometers from the
            Ethiopian-Eritrean border, near the site of the Erta Ale Volcano. The attack resulted in
            the death of five people, with others injured and kidnapped. Avoid all travel to the
            Danakil Desert area, bounded by the Ethio-Eritrean border and the roads between the
            towns of Dessie and Adigrat and Dessie and the Galafi border crossing with Djibouti.

            The presence of landmines poses a serious threat to visitors not travelling with a
            trusted tour company in the Danakil Desert. Explosions off the beaten path may cause
            injuries and death.
            Somali region (see Advisory)

            There is a high risk of kidnapping. Ongoing military operations against armed insurgent
            groups in the Somali region of Ethiopia and in the Ogaden and Hararge areas, toward the
            Somali border, have created an extremely volatile and dangerous security situation in
            which civilians have been killed and injured. Humanitarian missions, foreign aid workers
            as well as oil company workers and well operators in the Somali region have been subject
            to attacks and abductions by rebel groups including the Ogaden National Liberation Front
            (ONLF). The presence of landmines in this region poses an additional threat to safety.
            Border with South Sudan and Sudan (see Advisory)

            Tribal issues and sporadic incidents of violence have long affected part of the border
            area with South Sudan. In March 2012, a bus was ambushed by gunmen in the Gambella
            region, 22 km north of the city of Gambella on the road to Addis Ababa. Nineteen people
            were killed, and others were wounded or kidnapped. In April 2012, an agricultural site
            90 km south of the city of Gambella was attacked by gunmen, killing five and injuring
            nine. Although foreigners do not appear to be targeted, tensions are high and concerns
            regarding ethnic clashes and road banditry remain. Tensions remain high in western
            Oromia as well. Avoid non-essential travel to the city of Gambella where the security
            situation is generally more stable.

            Sporadic clashes have also occurred in the border areas with Sudan, particularly in
            thenorthwestern Amhara regions within 20km of the border with Sudan.
            Border with Kenya (see Advisory)

            Intertribal clashes, clan disputes, and banditry are common in this region and are
            fought by both Ethiopian and Kenyan security forces. This periodically raises tensions
            and cross-border violence has been reported. Armed groups hostile to the Government of
            Ethiopia operate in several areas near the border with Kenya.
            Terrorism

            Regional terror groups, including those associated with al Qaeda and al-Shabaab,
            continue to threaten Western interests and other potential targets in Ethiopia.
            Al-Shabaab threatened retaliation for the death of its leader in Somalia on September 1,
            2014.

            The September 21, 2013 attack on an upscale Nairobi mall illustrates the threat of
            attacks on civilians in East Africa. On October 13, 2013, a bomb exploded in the Bole
            neighbourhood of Addis Ababa, killing two people. Maintain a high level of vigilance and
            personal security awareness and avoid large crowds.

            In addition, domestic terrorist groups pose threats in certain regions, including in the
            Somali region, and parts of the Afar, Oromo, and Gambella regions. Be vigilant in
            crowded places and monitor local media.
            Demonstrations

            Politically and socially motivated demonstrations occur regularly and are often
            initiated with little or no advance notice. Some have escalated and turned violent in
            the past. They may occur more frequently in advance of the 2015 elections.

            In late April 2014, demonstrations were reported at universities in Oromia region, as
            well as in the larger area of Addis Ababa. Clashes between demonstrators and security
            forces were reported. Exercise caution, avoid public gatherings and demonstrations and
            follow the advice of local authorities. It is strongly recommended that you refrain from
            writing on blogs or social media about subjects of a political nature, as it could lead
            to detention and/or arrest.
            Crime

            There is a moderate level of crime in Ethiopia, including in the capital. Muggings,
            armed assaults and theft from parked cars happen. Crimes of opportunity, such as
            pickpocketing and purse snatching, are prevalent in Addis Ababa. Pickpockets and thieves
            are active throughout the city, but particularly on Bole Road and in the Piazza, the
            Merkato, and other areas frequented by tourists and foreigners. Crime significantly
            increases after dark, and foreigners should avoid walking alone after sundown.
            Similarly, driving outside of Addis Ababa after sundown is not advised due to banditry.
            Violent incidents

            In the last few years, small bombings and explosions have occurred in Addis Ababa.
            Targets have included government buildings, public transit, and local restaurants and
            cafés. If travelling in the capital, you should monitor local developments and remain in
            regular contact with the Embassy of Canada in Addis Ababa. Be vigilant and aware of your
            surroundings at all times.
            Road travel

            Apart from major arteries, roads are generally in poor condition and often unpaved.
            However, in recent years, the road network has significantly improved, particularly in
            and around Addis Ababa. Excessive speed, local driving habits, pedestrians, roaming
            animals, and poorly maintained vehicles pose hazards. Outside of Addis Ababa, overland
            travel should be undertaken during daylight hours only and in convoys if possible.
            Periodic fuel shortages can disrupt road travel.

            It is common for vehicles to be approached by beggars or vendors. It is illegal to give
            money to, or purchase something from, people who approach vehicles stopped in traffic.
            If caught, both the beggar/vendor and the vehicle operator may be fined. However, it is
            common for people, particularly children, to throw rocks at vehicles if their plea for
            money is ignored.

            Beware of individuals who appear to be offering assistance by signaling that there is a
            problem with your vehicle, as bandits frequently use this tactic to lure drivers out of
            their vehicles.

            Overland travel to the areas bordering Kenya, Somalia, Sudan and South Sudan is
            generally unsafe as banditry, including armed robbery and carjacking, is common.
            Landmines remain a hazard, particularly in the conflict zones of northern Ethiopia and
            near the areas bordering Sudan, South Sudan and Somalia.

            Traffic accidents occur regularly in Addis Ababa and throughout Ethiopia. Drivers should
            use extra caution as traffic moves unpredictably and rules of the road are not
            respected. If an accident occurs, it is illegal to move your vehicle before a police
            officer arrives. However, if the driver or passenger feels the situation is unsafe, he
            or she should leave immediately and report the incident to the nearest police station.
            Drivers should always carry a first-aid kit as medical facilities are often
            undersupplied.
            Air travel

            Upon entering the Bole International Airport in Addis Ababa, all bags are scanned,
            without exception, including checked-in luggage. Suitcases may also be searched
            manually. Baggage tags must be retained, as they must be presented upon exit from the
            airport baggage claim area, without exception.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            General safety information

            Local authorities are increasingly checking identification papers. Carry your passport
            with you at all times, and cooperate with authorities should you be questioned.

            Tourist facilities are limited outside Addis Ababa, and any travel outside the capital,
            especially in rural areas, should be carefully planned.

            Power outages are frequent, particularly during the dry season (November to June). Not
            all buildings have generators, so outages can result in lack of street lighting,
            restaurants and supermarkets without adequate refrigeration, and gas stations unable to
            supply fuel. Carry flashlights and backup supplies.

            Carry identification at all times and safely store certified photocopies of passports,
            visas and other travel documents.

            Remain discreet and avoid displaying any signs of affluence in public. Valuables or bags
            should not be left unattended.

            Although coverage can be poor outside urban centres, it is improving and it is still
            advisable to carry a cellular phone in case of emergency. In an emergency, call 991 for
            police, fire department or ambulance services.

            Crime

            The crime rate is very low. Exercise normal precautions and ensure that your personal
            belongings, passport and other travel documents are secure at all times.
            Landmines

            Unexploded landmines from the 1982 conflict with Argentina remain on the Falkland
            Islands. All mine fields are fenced off with barbed wire and identified with red warning
            triangles. Do not enter the mine fields and do not damage or remove the fences or signs.
            Convicted offenders can expect jail sentences and heavy fines. Seek local advice for
            more information.
            Road travel

            Most roads are paved in Stanley but they are unpaved on the rest of the islands.
            Therefore, a four-wheel drive vehicle is required to visit the islands.
            Public transportation

            Taxis are widely available but do not have meters. Taxi fares should be negotiated prior
            to departure.

            While there are no public transportation services, a shuttle bus is available between
            Stanley and RAF Mount Pleasant Airport. You can easily rent a car or hire a tour guide
            or driver.
        </item>
        <item>
            Crime

            Petty crime, such as theft from hotel rooms and purse snatching, is common. Theft and
            assault, including armed and sexual assault, occur on occasion. Be particularly vigilant
            at night in urban areas. Do not show signs of affluence, and be cautious when exchanging
            money at hotels or withdrawing money from automated banking machines or banks. Ensure
            that your personal belongings, passports, and other travel documents are secure at all
            times.
            Transportation

            Road conditions and road safety can vary greatly throughout the country. Roads are
            adequate in major cities but poor in rural areas. Stay on main roads; avoid secondary
            roads. Roadside assistance is not widely available. Avoid driving outside of major
            cities after dark. Road hazards may include pedestrians, domestic or wild animals, lack
            of signage and poor lighting. Vehicles are not generally well-maintained. Traffic drives
            on the left.

            Use taxis and minibuses with yellow registration plates, which denote compliance with
            Land Transport Authority regulations. Unlicensed minibuses may not be insured. Do not
            share taxis with strangers.

            Travel by boat or ferries on coastal waters and inter-island trips should be undertaken
            only with a reputable tour company. If you are contemplating sea journeys, contact the
            Meteorological Office (tel.: 23401) or consult the Fiji Meteorological Service for
            weather reports.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            General safety information

            Do not walk alone after dark; avoid large gatherings, demonstrations of any size and
            military installations and personnel; and follow the advice of local authorities.

            Do not hike alone; the terrain can be hazardous. Consult local guides before setting
            out, and stay on marked paths.

            Riptides can be dangerous along the reefs and river estuaries. Seek local advice, as
            several drownings have occurred. If you participate in water-based activities, use a
            reputable company and ensure that its equipment meets safety requirements.
            Emergency services

            In an emergency, dial 917 to reach police and 911 for firefighters or an ambulance.

            Crime

            Petty crime (pickpocketing, bag snatching) occurs, particularly from April to September.
            Be particularly vigilant at automated banking machines (ABMs), the Helsinki railway
            station, the Helsinki metro, the Esplanade and trams.
            Demonstrations

            Demonstrations occur periodically and have the potential to suddenly turn violent. Avoid
            all demonstrations, follow the advice of local authorities, and monitor local media.
            Road travel

            Driving can be hazardous in winter. Icy road conditions are common. Some roads may
            close, particularly in northern areas. Be wary of moose wandering on major highways.

            For updates on road conditions, visit the Finnish website on Travel and traffic
            information.
            Public transportation

            Public transportation (bus, train, tram and subway) is extensive and very efficient.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            General safety information

            Exercise normal safety precautions. Ensure that personal belongings, passports and other
            travel documents are secure at all times, especially on public transportation.

            Crime

            Petty crime (pickpocketing and purse snatching) occur in major tourist areas, in
            department stores, in train and bus stations and aboard public transport, especially in
            larger cities. Purse snatchers operate both on foot and on motorcycles. These thieves
            are very skilled and often work in groups.

            There has been a significant increase in violent theft on public transportation in Paris
            and its suburbs. Thieves often use violence (bag snatching) and target people talking on
            phones. Limit the use of mobile phones while on public transportation to avoid
            attracting attention.

            If you are robbed, go to the nearest commissariat de police (police station) to report
            the crime. They will provide you with a declaration of theft. Keep a copy of this
            document, as you will need it if you require a new passport or you wish to make an
            insurance claim. If the theft occurred in the metro, you may ask for assistance from a
            metro agent, who will direct you to the nearest police station.
            Vigipirate Alert System

            The French government maintains a government alert system, Vigipirate (French only), the
            purpose of which is to protect the country’s population, infrastructures and
            institutions, and to prepare response measures in case of attack. French authorities
            increased the Vigipirate alert to the highest level (terrorist alert) for the
            Île-de-France region (Paris and the outlying areas) following the January 2015 attacks
            in France. A “heightened” alert is in effect for the rest of the country. Expect tighter
            security measures and increased police/military presence at airports and near media
            offices, shopping centres, places of worship, schools and public transportation in
            affected areas. Remain vigilant, keep informed of the current situation and follow the
            advice of local authorities.
            Road travel

            Roads in France are well maintained. Drive defensively and obey traffic regulations.
            Excessive speeding poses a risk.

            There is a high frequency of vehicle break-ins. Leave nothing in view in the vehicle and
            above all do not leave valuable objects, passports, money or credit cards in a vehicle.
            As well, never leave personal belongings unattended and use secure parking facilities,
            especially overnight. Be vigilant when renting automobiles, as rented vehicles are
            target of choice.

            Theft of parked cars or their contents is particularly common on beach roads in Corsica.
            There are also reports of thefts from vehicles parked at Normandy beaches and war
            cemeteries.

            Always be suspicious if individuals signal for you to stop on the highway. Drivers are
            often tricked into stopping their cars by thieves who either obstruct the road or
            distract the driver (for example by flashing their headlights). They may also pretend
            that you have a flat tire (which they sometimes puncture themselves). Once the vehicle
            is stopped, the thieves seize the opportunity to steal a bag or other valuable objects.
            Aggravated thefts sometimes occur at isolated rest stops along highways.

            Be especially vigilant when stopped at traffic lights, as bags are often snatched from
            the front passenger seat by thieves travelling on scooters. Keep windows closed and
            doors locked at all times.
            Demonstrations

            Strikes, student demonstrations, labour unrest and other protests occur occasionally.
            They can lead to significant disruptions to public transportation and postal services.
            Avoid all demonstrations and large gatherings as they have the potential to suddenly
            turn violent. Follow the advice of local authorities and monitor local media.
            Public transportation

            Major cities have an effective public transportation system and are served by an
            extensive intercity rail network.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            General safety information

            Exercise normal safety precautions. Never leave your bags unsupervised at a ticket
            office or a registration desk. Ensure that your personal belongings, passports and other
            travel documents are secure at all times. Ensure as well that your credit and debit
            cards, cash and any other financial resources are not all kept in the same place. Avoid
            showing signs of affluence and carrying large sums of cash.

            You are strongly advised to keep photocopies of the identification page of your
            passport, as well as your birth certificate, Canadian citizenship card, driver’s
            licence, train or plane tickets and credit cards. Keep originals and copies in a safe
            but separate place. If possible, consider scanning these documents and saving the files
            in your email account.

            Crime

            Petty crime occurs, particularly in urban areas. Ensure that your personal belongings,
            passports and other travel documents are secure at all times. Do not leave valuables
            unattended in vehicles. Motorcycle theft is common.
            Jungle expeditions

            Make prior arrangements before entering the jungle. It is considered a high-risk area
            owing to gold-panning activities and the potential targeting of foreign tourists by
            criminal gangs. Over the past few years, there have been cases of foreign tourists being
            kidnapped and held for ransom. If you intend to explore the jungle, exercise extreme
            caution and seek local advice in organizing expeditions.
            Demonstrations

            Strikes and demonstrations occur and have the potential to suddenly turn violent. They
            can lead to significant disruptions to traffic and public transportation. Avoid all
            demonstrations and large gatherings, follow the advice of local authorities and monitor
            local media. Roadblocks may be set up on main roads. Do not attempt to cross blockades,
            even if they appear unattended. Curfews may also be in effect.
            Transportation

            Major roads are paved and well maintained. Driving after dark can be dangerous,
            especially in the remote interior regions or on less-developed rural roads.

            Emergency call boxes can be found alongside main highways, but few are functional due to
            vandalism. If possible, carry a cellular phone and check the local cellular phone
            coverage.

            Rental cars and motorcycles are available in Cayenne, Kourou and St-Laurent.

            Public taxis and vans are relatively safe.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.

            Crime

            Petty crime, such as pickpocketing, purse snatching and vehicle break-ins, has
            increased, particularly in markets, transportation hubs and areas frequented by
            tourists. Do not show signs of affluence. Resisting a robbery can lead to further
            violence.

            Violent crime occurs, including business and residential robberies and armed attacks,
            particularly in Libreville and Port-Gentil. Remain alert to your surroundings and avoid
            walking alone after dark, even in places visited by tourists. You should also avoid
            walking alone on beaches.
            Fraud

            Cases of attempted fraud are frequently reported in this country. See our Overseas Fraud
            page for more information on scams abroad.
            Road travel

            Road conditions are poor and road signs are often insufficient. The use of a
            four-wheel-drive vehicle is recommended. Keep vehicle doors locked and windows closed.
            In the event of a traffic accident, proceed to the nearest police station. Towing and
            repair services are not widely available outside Libreville. There are frequent police
            roadblocks. Cooperate with local authorities and avoid travelling after dark.
            Public transportation

            You can use public transportation such as the train or the bus. The Transgabonese
            railroad offers a passenger train service that runs from Libreville to Franceville and
            makes stops in Ndjole, Booué and Lastoursville. When taking taxis in the cities,
            negotiate the price before getting in the cab. Most taxi drivers automatically double
            their fares after 9 pm.

            No reliable information about Gabon Airlines\' safety standards is available.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            General safety information

            Ensure that personal belongings, passport, and other travel documents are secure at all
            times.

            Tourist facilities are limited outside the capital. Ecotourism is generally safe;
            however, you should make arrangements only with reputable companies and not venture from
            your organized tour group.

            In case of an emergency, dial 177 for the police.
            Piracy

            Pirate attacks occur in coastal waters and, in some cases, farther out at sea. Mariners
            should take appropriate precautions. For additional information, consult the Live Piracy
            Report published by the International Maritime Bureau.

            Crime

            Petty crime such as pickpocketing and purse snatching has increased, particularly in
            crowded markets and on ferries.

            Theft from vehicles has also increased. Car doors should be locked and car windows
            closed at all times.

            Be aware of men called “bumsters” who approach tourists and offer to be tour guides. If
            approached, politely decline.

            Check with local authorities to determine which beaches are safe. Do not bring valuables
            or large sums of money to the beach. Avoid isolated beaches.

            Police roadblocks are common throughout the country and identity documents may be
            requested.

            Road travel

            In the greater Banjul area, main roads are paved but narrow, potholed and poorly lit.
            Most roads outside the capital are unpaved. Overland travel can be difficult without a
            four-wheel-drive vehicle, particularly during the rainy season. Avoid driving outside
            urban areas after dark. Contact the nearest police station if involved in a traffic
            accident. Stop at all security roadblocks and checkpoints and cooperate with the local
            authorities.
            Regional Travel

            Be careful when travelling overland to the Casamance region in Senegal, as separatist
            rebels operate in this area. Travellers have been attacked on roads leading north from
            Ziguinchor to Banjul and from Bignona to Sedoba, near the Gambian border. You should
            view the Travel Advice for Senegal before departing.

            It is dangerous to cross the Gambia River on wooden pirogues due to overcrowding and the
            lack of security measures.
            General safely information

            Do not show signs of affluence and ensure that personal belongings and travel documents
            are secure at all times. You should keep informed of local developments that could
            affect your safety.

            Abkhazia and South Ossetia (see Advisory)

            In August 2008, serious fighting broke out in Abkhazia and South Ossetia, as well as in
            other parts of the country, including Poti, Gori and northwest of Tbilisi. Russia and
            Georgia have since signed a ceasefire agreement, which has eased tensions in most of the
            country. However, tensions remain high in both breakaway regions. Unexploded ordnance,
            landmines and explosions may pose a risk in parts of Abkhazia and South Ossetia where
            military operations occurred.

            Terrorist attacks have recently been carried out in Abkhazia and South Ossetia.
            Terrorists typically use car bombs to target military and security facilities. Exercise
            a high level of personal security awareness at all times.

            Canadian officials may not be in a position to provide consular assistance to Canadians
            in these areas, due to security concerns and travel restrictions.
            Russian border regions

            Avoid entering or leaving the country via the following land borders with Russia:
            Chechnya, Dagestan, Ingushetia, North Ossetia, Kabardino-Balkaria and
            Karachay-Cherkessia.
            Crime and kidnapping

            Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, occurs. Inadequate lighting in
            public places increases the likelihood of crime. Do not carry large amounts of cash and
            do not display signs of affluence. Keep your valuables, passports and other travel
            documents in a secure place. Muggings, home invasions, carjackings, sexual assaults and
            other violent crimes against foreigners have been known to occur.

            Kidnappings have occurred in South Ossetia, Abkhazia and other areas bordering Russia.
            You should travel in a group. Do not walk or take the subway alone after dark. Vary your
            routine and lock doors to cars and residences. Avoid showing signs of affluence and
            exercise vigilance in crowded places, such as markets and public transportation
            facilities. Pay careful attention when your credit card is handled by others during
            payment processing.
            Demonstrations

            Political demonstrations take place regularly in Georgia, especially in Tbilisi.
            Demonstrations may cause travel disruption, and can become violent. Avoid all gatherings
            and demonstrations and stay away from areas where they occur, as they may turn violent
            without warning. You should also monitor local news reports and follow the advice of
            local authorities.
            Transportation

            Traffic accidents are a common cause of injury and death. Drive defensively. Poor road
            conditions, reduced driving standards, insufficient road markings and inadequate
            lighting create hazards. Avoid driving after dark.

            Use only officially marked taxis and negotiate fares in advance. Do not share rides with
            strangers.

            Exercise caution when travelling over long distances by train at night and alone. Do not
            leave the compartment unattended. Lock the cabin door from the inside.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            Mountaineering and hiking

            Do not travel alone. Use recognized groups and organizations. Accurate information on
            mountain conditions can be difficult to obtain. Weather in mountainous areas can be
            unpredictable.
            General safety information

            Standards of police practice may differ from those in Canada. The conviction rate is
            high, regardless of whether or not you are guilty.

            Crime

            Violent crime in Germany is low. However, petty crime (mugging, pickpocketing and purse
            snatching) occurs in major cities and train stations, airports and Christmas markets.

            Pickpockets often work in teams and target trains, railway stations and airports. Their
            methods include distracting the attention of a victim who is boarding or alighting from
            a train or surrounding the victim in line-ups or at check-in counters.

            Extremist youth gangs are a threat, particularly in some smaller urban areas and in
            parts of former East Germany. Gang members have been known to harass or attack
            individuals because of their race or for looking “foreign”.

            Arson attacks on parked vehicles have occurred.
            Terrorism

            The Government of Germany maintains a public alert system on terrorism. Visit the
            website of the German Federal Ministry of the Interior for more information. Continue to
            exercise normal security precautions.
            Demonstrations

            Demonstrations occur and have the potential to suddenly turn violent. Avoid all
            demonstrations and large gatherings, follow the advice of local authorities and monitor
            local media.

            Strikes may occasionally interfere with mail, telephone, transport and other services.
            Transportation

            Roads and public transportation are excellent in the west and good throughout the east.

            Rail service is widely available and reliable.

            Northern and Upper East regions

            Regional ethnic tensions remain a concern in the Northern and Upper East regions of
            Ghana. You should evaluate your need to travel to these areas given previous outbreaks
            of violence, which caused deaths and injuries in many areas, including in or near Tamale
            (the capital of the Northern Region), Gushegu (Northern Region), and Bawku (Upper East
            Region). When regional violence breaks out, local authorities often respond by imposing
            curfews. Consult local authorities before entering any of these regions to get the
            latest information.
            Crime

            Pick-pocketing, purse snatching and attacks by individuals on motorbikes are increasing
            in Accra and its surroundings, including areas around the High Commission of Canada.
            Violent crimes have also increased, including armed robbery. Be aware of your
            surroundings and avoid walking alone or displaying signs of wealth. Home invasions are
            on the rise. Affluent areas in Accra where foreigners live are targeted and some thieves
            carry firearms.

            There have been recent cases of violent robberies often targeting foreigners travelling
            in taxis at night. If you have to use a taxi, ensure that there is no other passenger in
            the car and try to limit trips to day-time hours.

            When possible, carry photocopies of your travel documents and keep the originals in a
            secure place.

            Be very careful when driving in Ghana. People may try to get you to stop your vehicle.
            Pedestrians may bang on your car, making it appear as if they have been hit, and drivers
            may attempt to cause minor vehicle collisions. Crowds gathering as a result of these
            types of incidents can become dangerous. Drive with your doors locked and proceed
            immediately to the nearest police station to make a report if you are involved in any
            traffic incident.

            An increase in crime has also affected Tema, Kumasi, and the Upper East and West
            regions. Armed robberies of vehicles are a growing concern in areas such as Takoradi,
            Kumasi and other parts of the Ashanti region. People working in the mining industry
            should be particularly cautious. Armed attacks have also been reported along the
            Accra-Tema and Accra-Kumasi-Tamale highways. You should remain vigilant at all times.

            Thefts occur at Kotoka International Airport in Accra and in hotels across the country.
            Be wary of unsolicited assistance from uniformed porters or officials appearing to work
            at Kotoka International Airport. Official airport employees wear identification cards
            bearing both their name and photograph. If you are being met at the airport, you should
            confirm the identity of your driver.
            Demonstrations

            Demonstrations occasionally occur in Accra and other major cities. You are advised to be
            prudent and avoid large crowds and public gatherings, as some have turned violent in the
            past. Monitor local news reports, follow the advice of authorities, and respect any
            curfews or roadblocks.
            Fraud

            Canadians are frequently the victims of Internet scams originating in Ghana, which is a
            base for commercial and Internet fraud schemes in the region. Scammers will offer
            enticing business or financial opportunities, often related to the gold industry. Be
            wary of unsolicited emails. Ensure that any business opportunity is legitimate before
            travelling to Ghana.

            Other scams involve online friendships or romances. There are many variations, all with
            the intent of scamming money from people abroad, and some Canadians have lost thousands
            of dollars and in some cases, have been arrested as a result of such situation.

            Credit card fraud is also a considerable problem. Limit your use of credit cards
            whenever possible.

            See our Overseas Fraud page for more information on scams abroad.
            Road travel

            Road conditions are generally good in cities, but poor in rural areas. Inadequate
            lighting, pedestrians and roaming livestock pose risks. Traffic accidents are common on
            the road from Accra to Cape Coast and Kumasi. Travel outside urban areas should be
            restricted to daylight hours. In the event of an accident, you should stay in your car
            and contact help with a mobile phone or proceed to the nearest police station and
            contact the High Commission of Canada in Accra if necessary.

            Police roadblocks are routine. At checkpoints, vehicles and passengers may be subject to
            inspections, and armed security forces may demand money, either directly or indirectly.
            You should always carry copies of identification documents, such as your passport and
            valid visa, and your International Driving Permit (IDP). Vehicles with temporary licence
            plates (DVLA) are prohibited from traveling anywhere in Ghana between 6:00 p.m. and 6:00
            a.m. Vehicles may be seized for the night and fines imposed for non-compliance.
            Furthermore, as border closures are frequent, seek the advice of the High Commission of
            Canada in Accra prior to departure if you are planning on leaving Ghana by road.
            Public transportation

            Buses are unreliable and inconvenient. Car rentals are available but expensive. Taxis
            are also available, but taxi fares should be agreed before departure. Domestic air
            travel may be subject to disruptions.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            Reserves, safaris and the beach

            There are inherent risks associated with viewing wildlife (both marine and on land),
            particularly on foot or at close range. You should always maintain a safe distance when
            observing wildlife and avoid exiting vehicles unless professional guides or wardens say
            it is safe. Use reputable and professional guides or tour operators and closely follow
            park regulations and wardens’ advice.

            Avoid isolated picnic areas and beaches. Coastal waters have unpredictable wave and tide
            patterns and can be dangerous. On many beaches, there are serious and strong undertows
            and riptides that can sweep swimmers out to sea. Follow the advice and warnings of local
            authorities.
            Piracy

            Pirate attacks and armed robbery against ships occur in coastal waters. Mariners should
            take appropriate precautions. For additional information, consult the Live Piracy Report
            published by the International Maritime Bureau.
            General safety information

            Contact local police in the event of an emergency. Emergencies: 191 (country-wide) or
            (0302) 77-36-95, 77-39-06, or 78-73-73. Ambulance: 192 (country-wide).

            Periodic shortages of electricity and city water can occur, especially in the dry season
            from November to March.

        <item>
            Crime

            The crime rate is low. Petty crime occurs, such as pickpocketing and theft of unattended
            baggage. Unattended vehicles are occasional targets. Exercise normal precautions and
            ensure that your personal belongings, passports and other travel documents are secure at
            all times.
            Spiked food and drinks

            Never leave food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers. Be wary of accepting
            snacks, beverages, gum, or cigarettes from new acquaintances, as they may contain drugs
            that could put you at risk of sexual assault and robbery.
            Road travel

            Persons travelling overland between Gibraltar and Spain may experience delays at the
            border. Occasionally, overland travel is completely cut off, leaving air travel as the
            only way into Gibraltar.

            Strikes and Demonstrations

            Strikes and demonstrations in Athens are a common occurrence due to austerity measures
            imposed by the government. Demonstrations and marches occur largely in the centre of
            Athens in Syntagma Square and in front of the Parliament building. Avoid all public
            gatherings and demonstrations and stay away from areas where they can occur as they may
            turn violent without notice. Monitor local media and follow the advice of local
            authorities.

            Strikes and demonstrations affecting public health services and transportation, such as
            trains, buses, taxi, metro, ferries and cruise ships, are usually announced in advance.
            Road closures may occur at short notice, particularly in Athens. Flights may be
            disrupted and access to airports and ports may be difficult. Contact your airline to
            check the status of your flight and allow plenty of time to make your way to the
            airport.
            Terrorism

            There have been periodic bomb attacks by anarchists and ultra-leftist militant groups
            against the Greek state, Greek institutions, and Western commercial and diplomatic
            interests on the mainland, including in Athens and Thessaloniki. Several bomb and arson
            attacks have occurred in urban areas. To enhance public safety, police officers conduct
            patrols in subway stations, bus terminals and other public places.

            Several attacks occurred in Athens in January 2013 in response to the latest round of
            austerity measures, as well as measures dealing with crime and corruption that were
            imposed by the Greek government.
            Crime

            Petty crime (pickpocketing, purse snatching, luggage theft, muggings) occurs in tourist
            areas and on public transport. Do not walk in the Athens districts of Monastiraki and
            Omonia, or around the two railway stations of Larissa and Peloponissos after dark. Avoid
            secluded areas, parks, and down-market bars and restaurants. Remain vigilant at all
            times.

            Women should not accept rides from strangers or casual acquaintances. Sexual assaults
            have occurred, particularly on the islands.

            Attacks against non-Caucasians have been reported in Athens and condemned by local
            authorities.
            Road travel

            The traffic fatality rate in Greece is among the highest in the European Union. Poor
            driving standards, aggressive drivers, difficult terrain and heavy traffic create
            hazards.

            Driving motorbikes, scooters and mopeds is particularly dangerous, especially on the
            islands. Travellers must obtain insurance coverage. A helmet is a legal requirement.
            Stiff fines can be imposed for non-compliance.

            Small, unlicensed rental agencies (especially on the islands) do not always offer
            vehicles that comply with up-to-date safety standards. Read the rental contract
            carefully.

            In the event of an accident, wait until the police arrive; otherwise the insurance may
            not be valid.
            Public transportation

            Accidents have occurred due to poor safety standards on regional buses and ferries. Use
            reputable bus and ferry operators.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            General safety information

            Exercise normal safety precautions. Ensure that your personal belongings, passports and
            other travel documents are secure at all times. Do not show signs of affluence and avoid
            carrying large sums of cash.

            Tourist facilities are widely available.

            Some border areas are militarily sensitive and should be avoided, including the
            north-northwest zone.

            Crime

            The crime rate is low. There are no serious security or safety concerns.
            Transportation

            Arctic weather conditions may cause delays and interruptions in transport services.
            Travellers should carry enough funds to cover unexpected expenses.

            There are no roads or railways between towns. Travel is possible only by air, sea, ski,
            snowmobile, or dogsled.

            Air Greenland operates regular domestic flights between all towns and larger
            settlements.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            Tourism and expeditions

            Tourist facilities are limited. Main tourist centres are located in Ilulissat, Disko
            Bay, and southern Greenland.

            You must apply for a special permit at the Ministry of Domestic Affairs, Nature and
            Environment of Greenland to explore glaciers, mountains or Northeast Greenland National
            Park. Travelling with a tour operator is recommended.
            General Safety Measures

            Exercise normal safety precautions. Ensure personal belongings, passports and other
            travel documents are secure at all time.

            Crime

            Petty crime occurs and increases just before and during annual festivities, such as the
            Carnival in August. Ensure that your personal belongings, passports and other travel
            documents are secure at all times. Avoid unpatrolled beaches and unpopulated areas,
            especially after dark. Check with local authorities to determine which beaches are safe.
            Road travel

            Traffic drives on the left. Roadside assistance is not widely available. Most roads are
            narrow and winding. Look out for pedestrians as most roads do not have sidewalks. Road
            surfaces often deteriorate during periods of intense heat and during the hurricane
            season. Drive defensively at all times. Grenada has a seat belt law and drivers and
            passengers found without a seat belt are subject to a fine.
            Public transportation

            Ferry services are available between Grenada and its sister islands of Carriacou and
            Petite Martinique. Water taxis operate between tourist hotels on Grand Anse beach and
            the capital.

            Standard taxi fares exist for most destinations. Confirm fare before departing. A
            network of private minibuses operates at fixed fares throughout the island. Rental cars
            can be hired locally.

            with local authorities to determine which beaches are safe.
            Demonstrations

            Demonstrations occur and have the potential to suddenly turn violent. Avoid all
            demonstrations and large gatherings, follow the advice of local authorities and monitor
            local media. Strikes may occasionally interfere with services.
            Transportation

            Roads are paved and maintained, and traffic safety is enforced by the police. The use of
            seatbelts is mandatory. Rented vehicles are available.

            Bus services are available in most major towns. However, buses operate only during
            certain hours. Schedules are unreliable. Ferry services provide transportation to
            associated islands. Taxis are safe but expensive; fares increase between 9 p.m. and 7
            a.m.

            Crime

            Guatemala has one of the highest rates of violent crime in Latin America, but a very low
            arrest and detention rate. Most incidents are drug and gang related and occur in and
            around Guatemala City, in other major cities and in rural areas. Drug-related violence
            has led to a number of armed attacks in southeastern districts close to the borders with
            El Salvador and Honduras and in northern districts along the border with Mexico.

            Handguns and other small arms are very common. Criminals often operate in groups.
            Foreigners are often targets of robbery, carjacking, armed assault, sexual assault and
            rape. Crime levels tend to increase during the holiday seasons. Always maintain a high
            level of personal security awareness.

            Do not display signs of affluence, especially in airports. Avoid travelling alone
            (especially late at night) and avoid low-cost hotels with poor security. Ensure that
            your personal belongings, passports and other travel documents are secure at all times.
            Carry only a copy of the identification page of your passport and sufficient funds for
            the day. Never display laptop computers, mobile phones or other electronic devices.
            Exercise extreme caution when using automated banking machines (ABMs). If you are
            threatened by robbers, stay calm and do not resist: injuries and deaths have occurred
            when victims have resisted.

            Vigilante justice has increased in rural areas, resulting in lynching suspected child
            kidnappers and other suspected criminals. Avoid large crowds and gatherings because of
            the potential for violence.
            Demonstrations

            Demonstrations occur and have the potential to suddenly turn violent. They can lead to
            significant disruptions to traffic and public transportation. Participation in
            demonstrations by foreigners may result in detention, expulsion, and the denial of
            future entry into Guatemala. We recommend that you avoid all demonstrations and large
            gatherings, follow the advice of local authorities and monitor local media.
            Road travel

            Tourists may obtain up-to-date security information through the Guatemalan Tourism
            Institute, INGUAT (service available in English). INGUAT has a dedicated program aimed
            at tourist assistance, known as PROATUR, which can be reached by telephone at +502 2421
            2810 or 1500 when calling from within Guatemala.

            PROATUR can assist in arranging, with the National Police, security escorts for any road
            travel across the country. This arrangement must be done ahead of time. Tourists can
            request this service by email to operacionesproatur@inguat.gob.gt. While the service is
            free, you should expect to pay gratuities and gasoline.

            Only undertake intercity travel by car during daylight hours, preferably in a convoy of
            two or more vehicles.

            Secondary streets and rural roads are poorly lit. Local motorists rarely obey traffic
            laws. Steep, winding mountain roads and a lack of road signs present additional dangers.

            Military and police forces conduct random vehicle searches along the border with Mexico.

            The Inter-American (or Pan-American) Highway (CA-1) and the road from Guatemala City to
            the Atlantic Ocean are dangerous because of heavy traffic. Off-road travel in the remote
            highlands should be undertaken only after seeking advice from PROATUR.

            Avoid travelling on the isolated, small dirt roads near Lake Atitlán. The safest route
            to Lake Atitlán is via the Inter-American Highway and Sololá, although this is where
            most disturbances occur. Avoid travelling on the road from Godinez to Panajachel as it
            is dangerous and rarely patrolled by police. Armed robberies against vehicles with
            foreign licence plates have occurred on the Pacific Coast Highway (CA-2) and the
            Atlantic Highway (CA-9).

            Roadblocks, which can cause major traffic disruptions, have been reported along roads
            leading to and from airports. Do not attempt to pass through a roadblock, even if it
            appears unattended. Stay alert to new developments through local media reports and amend
            your travel arrangements accordingly.

            Roadblocks erected by armed gangs are common, particularly in the northern and western
            departments of San Marcos, Huehuetenango, Quiché, Alta Verapaz, Petén and Escuintla.
            Criminals have been known to pose as police officers. Comply and do not resist if
            attacked. Always drive with car windows closed and doors locked.

            Allow enough time for border formalities so that you can arrive in a major town before
            dark. Many border posts close for lunch and at dusk. Avoid exchanging money at border
            crossings, unless absolutely necessary, as doing so has sometimes resulted in armed
            robbery.
            Public transportation

            Local and intercity public buses are not safe. Problems include mechanical
            unreliability, the use of unlicensed drivers, frequent major road accidents and crime on
            board. Pickpocketing and armed robbery are daily occurrences.

            Public buses are frequently targeted by gangs who hurl grenades or fire shots as a way
            of ensuring compliance to extortion demands or to settle accounts. Drivers have been the
            targets of violence, including murder. Passengers have been subject to armed robbery,
            sometimes by fellow passengers.

            Do not travel on local public buses (“chicken buses”). Tourist shuttles travelling
            between popular destinations have been targeted by hijackers in the past.

            Only travel on intercity buses during daylight hours and with reliable tour companies,
            as fraud has occurred.

            Ensure that transportation and tour providers are reputable and reliable before booking.
            PROATUR or hotel staff can provide you with advice on the safest companies. In Guatemala
            City, only use official taxis and make detailed arrangements for the return trip. Advice
            on reliable taxi companies may also be obtained by inquiring with PROATUR or hotel
            staff.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            General security information

            Tourists may obtain up-to-date security information through the Guatemalan Tourism
            Institute, INGUAT (service available in English). INGUAT has a dedicated program aimed
            at tourist assistance, known as PROATUR, which can be reached by telephone at +502 2421
            2810 or 1500 when calling from within Guatemala.

            When visiting volcanoes and other tourist sites, you should travel in groups and with a
            reputable tour company. Sexual assaults and robberies can occur, especially when
            security personnel normally deployed on these sites are absent. Stay informed of
            security conditions in the areas you plan to visit.

            Do not approach or photograph children and women, since many people in Guatemala fear
            that children are being kidnapped for adoption or for theft of vital organs. Violent
            incidents involving foreigners have occurred.

            Cruise-ship passengers who book a tour or make other travel arrangements should ensure
            that the company is recognized by the cruise line. Confirm your itinerary with the ship
            and port authority, as well as with PROATUR.

            Exercise caution when swimming off the Pacific coast, and seek information about water
            conditions such as strong currents, riptides and undertow. Avoid deserted and
            unpatrolled beaches.
            Emergency services

            Dial 110 or 120 for police and 122 or 123 for the fire department and ambulance
            services. It may be difficult to obtain police assistance. Police forces lack resources
            and are often corrupt. National police officers do not speak English. PROATUR officers
            are able to provide assistance in English.

            Ebola

            Screening measures are in place at entry points in an attempt to contain the Ebola
            outbreak. Some airlines have suspended flights to and from Guinea. Confirm the status of
            your flight with the airline before heading to the airport.

            Ebola facilities and health workers have often been attacked in the past year.
            Increased threat of attacks and kidnappings

            In 2013, the French military assisted the Malian government in efforts to repel armed
            rebels. Terrorist groups in the region declared their intention to increase attacks and
            kidnappings targeting Westerners. While the United Nations peacekeeping mission in Mali
            has been supporting the transitional authorities in stabilizing the region since July
            2013, citizens of countries supporting the intervention are still at particular risk,
            but all travellers should exercise increased vigilance in the region.
            Crime

            Violent crime is prevalent, especially in Conakry, but also in some rural areas such as
            Kankan. Armed robbery, carjackings, assaults, muggings and break-ins are on the rise in
            Conakry and the surrounding province. These violent crimes are often perpetrated by men
            wearing military or police uniforms. Guinean authorities have implemented the
            restoration of checkpoints (police and gendarmerie) on major roads in Conakry and other
            cities between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m.

            Foreigners are often targets of crime, especially at airports. Exercise caution at
            airports and hotels, where offers of unsolicited assistance may come from persons
            seeking an opportunity to steal luggage, purses or wallets. You should arrange to arrive
            at the airport during the day and be met there by reliable contacts.

            Petty crime such as pickpocketing and purse-snatching is common, particularly in the
            Madina, Niger, and Taouyah markets, and often employs children. Do not show signs of
            affluence. Ensure personal belongings and travel documents are secure at all times, and
            remain alert to your surroundings, especially at night.
            Demonstrations

            Demonstrations occur regularly and have the potential to suddenly turn violent. Protests
            over the political deadlock in the country, coupled with the lack of provision of public
            services have led to violent incidents across the country in the past months, causing
            deaths and injuries. These protests can lead to significant disruptions to traffic and
            public transportation. Avoid all demonstrations and large gatherings, follow the advice
            of local authorities and monitor local media.
            Shortages

            The socio-economic situation is also generally unstable in Guinea. Conakry has been
            experiencing fuel and water shortages in recent months. This has affected transportation
            as well as the power supply, and has led to civil unrest causing death and injuries.
            Transportation

            Driving habits, the lack of road and traffic signs, poorly maintained vehicles and
            roads, pedestrians and livestock pose hazards. In the event of an accident, you should
            proceed to the nearest police station or medical facility, as roadside assistance and
            ambulance services are not available.

            You should be careful while driving in Conakry and surrounding areas, and when
            travelling to and from the international airport, due to a reported increase in violent
            and opportunistic crimes against foreigners. The risk of robberies and armed attacks
            also increases after dark. Moreover, it is not rare for travellers to encounter
            improvised roadblocks (including on the airport road) erected by armed groups or
            military troops. Payment or proof of identity may be required at these roadblocks. The
            following documents should be carried at all times: copies of identity papers (passport
            and visa), vaccination record, vehicle registration (grey card), valid driver\'s
            licence, proof of road insurance, and vehicle safety check certificate.

            Overland travel outside major centres should only be undertaken during daylight hours
            and with a four-wheel-drive vehicle with spare tires. The vehicle should also be
            equipped with water, means of communication, a reflective hazard triangle, a fire
            extinguisher and a first aid kit. We recommend driving in convoy. Road travel outside
            the capital may be difficult during the rainy season.

            Guinea has no official public transportation system. Although informal means of communal
            transport exist, such as taxis and buses, they should be used with extreme caution.
            Airline companies offer regular links from Conakry to the cities of Kankan, Siguiri,
            Labé and N’zérékoré.

            There is an airport departure tax, which may not be included in the price of the plane
            ticket. Please check with your air carrier.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            Fraud

            Cases of attempted fraud are frequently reported in this country. See our Overseas Fraud
            page for more information on scams abroad.
            Piracy

            Pirate attacks occur in coastal waters, and in some cases, further out at sea. Mariners
            should take appropriate precautions. For additional information, consult the Live Piracy
            Report published by the International Maritime Bureau.
            General safety information

            In the event of a strike, shops could close for long periods of time with little
            warning. Ensure that you maintain stores of food, water and emergency supplies,
            sufficient to last three to four days.

            Power outages are frequent throughout the country and may affect security conditions,
            especially in large urban centres.

            Tourist facilities are limited outside the capital.

            Area bordering Senegal (see Advisory)

            Casamance rebels are present in the area bordering Senegal, where the rampant small arms
            proliferation fuels banditry. It may be dangerous to cross this border by land.
            Bijagós Islands

            To reach the Bijagós Islands from the mainland, you must use chartered air services or
            travel by boat. Avoid pirogues as they are unsafe. There are tour operators that
            organize boat trips to the islands. In the event of an emergency on the islands, contact
            the Embassy of Canada to Senegal, in Dakar.
            Crime

            Crime rates are high. Incidents of road banditry and carjacking pose a risk for
            travellers. Avoid travelling at night and be particularly vigilant outside major cities.

            Petty crime, including pickpocketing, is common at the airport, in markets and at public
            gatherings. Burglaries are regularly reported and security is inadequate. Ensure that
            your personal belongings and travel documents are secure at all times and avoid walking
            alone after dark. Avoid driving after dark, and always keep doors locked and windows
            rolled up.
            Demonstrations

            Demonstrations occur and have the potential to suddenly turn violent. Avoid political
            events and other situations where demonstrations may occur, follow the advice of local
            authorities and monitor local media.
            Road travel

            Roads are poorly lit and not well maintained. Do not leave the roads and pathways
            designated by local authorities because of the potential existence of minefields.
            Guinea-Bissau does not participate in the International Driving Permit (IDP) program.
            You should hire a driver. If you are Canadian and hold a valid Canadian driver’s
            licence, you can drive for a maximum of three months. After three months, youshould
            contact the International Cooperation Directorate to obtain a volunteer’s licence; if
            you are in the private sector, you should contact the Transportation Directorate for a
            Guinean licence.
            General safety information

            Although non-governmental organizations are working on the clearance of minefields, it
            is possible that unexploded military ammunition and antipersonnel mines are still
            present outside Bissau, especially in the regions of Bafatá, Oio, Biombo, Quinara and
            Tombali.

            Tourist facilities are limited.

            Telecommunications are expensive and unreliable. Infrastructure is inadequate.
            Electricity and water supplies are often available for only a few hours a day.

            Crime

            Crime levels in Guyana are high. Assaults, pickpocketing, purse snatching, break-ins,
            armed robberies, car thefts and carjacking are common occurrences, particularly in
            Georgetown, including Stabroek Market, Tiger Bay and South Georgetown. The sea wall,
            from east of the Pegasus Hotel extending to Sheriff Street and adjacent areas, has been
            the site of several crimes and should be avoided after dark. Other dangerous areas
            include the East Coast Demerara region (especially near the villages of Buxton,
            Lusignan, Friendship and Annadale), the East Bank Demerara region and the New Amsterdam
            area. Violent attacks have also occurred on the road to and from Cheddi Jagan
            International Airport and on the Linden Highway, especially at night.

            Foreigners and returning Guyanese citizens are favourite targets for criminals.
            Canadians have been injured while being robbed at gunpoint, and some have reported being
            attacked after withdrawing money at financial institutions. Avoid carrying large amounts
            of cash.

            Execution-style killings have been reported. However, these appear to be targeted and
            not random crimes. Gangs also continue to perpetrate attacks in the Amazon jungle near
            the border with Suriname.

            Pay attention to your surroundings, especially when entering or leaving vehicles,
            residences and public places. Ensure that your personal belongings, passports and other
            travel documents are secure at all times. Do not show signs of affluence. When
            approached by a police officer, always ask to see identification.
            Demonstrations and civil unrest

            Demonstrations and civil unrest occur sporadically throughout the country. On November
            10, 2014, the president of Guyana prorogued Parliament. General elections are planned
            for May 11, 2015. Ongoing political tensions may lead to demonstrations, which have the
            potential to become violent. Avoid large crowds and demonstrations, and monitor local
            news reports for the latest information.
            Road travel

            Vehicles drive on the left. Poor road conditions, inadequate lighting, roaming animals
            and poor driving habits are constant hazards. Be extremely cautious when driving, keep
            windows closed and doors locked at all times, and avoid being on the road unnecessarily
            after dark.

            Exercise caution along the road from the Cheddi Jagan Airport to Georgetown and on the
            Timerhi/Linden Highway.
            Public transportation

            Avoid public minibuses, as they tend to be overloaded, poorly maintained and badly
            driven.

            Taxis are the safest means of transportation. Do not hail taxis from the roadside. Only
            use taxis that are connected to major hotels or are painted yellow. All yellow taxies
            are registered with the Government of Guyana\'s licencing office. Exercise constant
            vigilance, and make note of the vehicle\'s licence plate before entering, in order to
            track down the driver in the event of overcharging or lost luggage.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            Piracy

            Pirate attacks occur in coastal waters. Mariners should take appropriate precautions.
            For additional information, consult the Live Piracy Report published by the
            International Maritime Bureau.
            Emergency services

            Dial 911 for police, 912 for firefighters and 913 for ambulance services.

            Response time may be delayed due to a lack of resources, especially for traffic
            accidents. Injured persons (unless seriously injured) are frequently transported by
            bystanders. Local authorities are cooperative, but assistance is limited and may be
            available only during business hours.
        </item>

            Neighbourhoods of Martissant, Carrefour, Bel Air and Cité Soleil, in the Port-au-Prince
            area (see Advisory)

            These areas continue to be dangerous due to criminal activity and the local
            authorities\' lack of capacity to ensure order. Personal safety and a police presence
            are not guaranteed. The police are unable to respond in a timely manner to calls for
            assistance in these areas. It is strongly advised to avoid going out after nightfall.

            It is imperative that Canadians who must travel to these areas take appropriate security
            precautions. Ensure that family members, friends, colleagues, local business
            representatives or organizations know when to expect you so they can meet you as soon as
            you arrive at the airport or border, and can guide you in your travels. The use of
            public transport of any kind is not recommended. As the security situation can change at
            any moment, check with the organizations, institutes or hosts that are taking care of
            you to receive the latest updates on the region to which you are travelling.
            Crime

            Crime rates are high and the security situation is unpredictable. Remain extremely
            vigilant wherever you are in the country. Criminal activity is especially prevalent in
            large centres such as downtown Port-au-Prince, where armed gangs continue to operate.
            There have been reports of murders, kidnappings, armed robbery, burglary and carjacking,
            even in daylight hours. Never walk alone and avoid travelling after nightfall.

            Avoid showing visible signs of affluence, such as expensive-looking jewellery or
            electronic equipment. Foreigners, including Canadians, are viewed as wealthy. Remain
            cautious with new acquaintances offering friendship or hospitality.

            Armed robbers sometimes target travellers, particularly foreigners of Haitian origin,
            arriving on international flights at the Toussaint Louverture International Airport in
            Port-au-Prince. In most cases, the victims’ vehicles are followed by criminals on
            motorcycles. To minimize the risk of violence, you should have your local contacts
            arrange for your pick-up from the airport, carry only small amounts of cash and not
            resist if you are threatened by robbers. Be extremely vigilant when leaving the airport.

            A large number of gang leaders and offenders detained at the Croix-des-Bouquets civil
            penitentiary (east of Port-au-Prince) escaped in 2014 and are still at large.

            Exercise a high degree of caution when travelling near the border area with the
            Dominican Republic due to high levels of criminal activity.

            Members of the general Haitian population, regardless of rank or social class, are at
            risk of being kidnapped. Although rare, there have been kidnappings involving Canadians
            and other foreign nationals, including missionaries, aid workers and children. Most
            victims have been released upon the payment of a ransom. In some exceptional cases,
            however, victims have disappeared or have been killed.

            Remain alert to small groups of loiterers, especially near your residence. Keep doors
            and windows secure at all times. Instruct domestic staff to permit only pre-authorized
            visitors whose identities have been verified into your home. Keep all visitors under
            close scrutiny.

            Keep windows closed and doors locked when travelling by car. There have been several
            recent reports of violent incidents along Route Nationale 2, between the area of
            Petit‑Goâve (Ouest Department) and Miragoane (Nippes Department). Criminal gangs have
            committed robberies by erecting roadblocks. If you have to travel through this area,
            remain extremely vigilant and follow the advice of local authorities.

            Be cautious when using automated banking machines, and do so only during business hours
            inside a bank. It is advisable to deal directly with a teller. Avoid carrying large sums
            of money and be vigilant when entering or leaving a bank, as criminals could be watching
            and could attempt to rob you as you leave.

            Avoid photographing individuals without first obtaining their permission. Be cautious
            when photographing scenes in poor or urban areas, where people may feel exploited or
            insulted by being subjects of such activities.
            Demonstrations and unrest

            Haiti periodically experiences social unrest, particularly during periods of political
            uncertainty and elections. The dissolution of Haiti’s parliament on January 13, 2015 and
            the current electoral situation have heightened tensions in the capital and throughout
            the country. Protests are ongoing and could become violent. Rioting could occur on
            little or no notice. Exercise a high degree of caution, avoid all demonstrations and
            regularly monitor local media to keep abreast of the situation.

            Protest marches, strikes and road-blocks may occur at any time in the capital,
            throughout the country and on main highways. Movement may be restricted and local
            transportation services may be disrupted. Since August 2014, there have been several
            reports of violent incidents and anti-government demonstrations along Route Nationale 2
            in the vicinity of Petit-Goave (Ouest Department).
            Road travel

            Roads are narrow and poorly maintained. Most vehicles are in poor condition. The few
            traffic lights that are operational are mostly in urban centres. Traffic signs are rare.
            Driving at night or in bad weather should be avoided, even in the city. Streets are
            rarely lit, and vehicles being driven with their lights off are common. Vehicles are
            often abandoned on or beside the road. Many people drive while intoxicated and do not
            follow the rules of the road.

            Since there are frequent disruptions of fuel supplies, fuel tanks should always be kept
            at least half full.

            Because of a lack of police and roadside assistance services, you should carry a cell
            phone and a list of emergency contact numbers. However, cell phone coverage is
            intermittent in some rural areas.
            Public transportation

            Avoid all public transportation, especially shared taxis (“tap-taps”) and buses. Drivers
            do not always follow the rules of the road and their vehicles are sometimes in poor
            condition or overloaded, which often leads to serious accidents involving injuries and
            sometimes death.
            Marine transportation

            Ferry accidents sometimes occur due to overloading and poor maintenance of some vessels.
            Do not board vessels that appear overloaded or unseaworthy.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.

            Crime

            Exercise a high degree of caution throughout Honduras, which has one of the highest
            homicide rates in the world. Drug trafficking, transnational organized crime and the
            presence of street gangs pose significant security concerns and contribute to the high
            rate of crime. Apprehension and conviction rates of criminals remain low. A large
            percentage of the population is armed. Guns and weapons such as machetes and knives are
            frequently used in robberies. If you are threatened by robbers, do not resist; injuries
            and deaths have occurred when victims have resisted.

            Serious crime—including armed robbery, kidnapping, carjacking, home invasion and sexual
            assault—is common, and armed attacks on marine vessels have been reported. Although most
            criminals do not target tourists, some have been victims of crime in major cities and in
            areas frequented by tourists, especially at night. Exercise increased vigilance in the
            departments along the Atlantic coast, along the border with Guatemala and in the eastern
            departments of Gracias a Dios, Olancho and Colón, and in rural areas north of Nacaome,
            Valle, and north of Choluteca, Choluteca. Exercise increased caution while in the cities
            of San Pedro Sula (including in vehicles leaving the airport), the Bay Islands
            (comprising Roatán, Útila and Guanaja), Trujillo and Tegucigalpa.

            In Roatán, robbers have targeted homes and long-term leased residences. Since 2009,
            three Canadian citizens have been murdered in the Bay Islands. Travellers visiting the
            Bay Islands should exercise particular caution around uninhabited coastal areas and
            avoid walking on isolated beaches, especially at night. Foreigners have been assaulted
            on beaches in the Bay Islands and along the Atlantic Coast.

            Travellers have been followed and assaulted. Use discretion when discussing your travel
            plans in public. Be cautious when dealing with strangers or recent acquaintances and be
            extremely careful when accepting rides or invitations. Remain aware of your surroundings
            at all times, especially after dark and when travelling alone.

            Never leave food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers. Be wary of accepting
            snacks, beverages, gum or cigarettes from new acquaintances, as they may contain drugs
            that could put you at risk of sexual assault and robbery.

            In resort areas, stay on supervised beaches and do not walk in isolated or unpopulated
            areas. Hitchhiking is strongly discouraged everywhere in the country. Campers should
            always stay in well-lit campgrounds that have security patrols. Whenever possible, walk
            in a group, as there have been reports of attacks on tourists walking alone.

            Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and bag snatching, is prevalent. Be highly vigilant
            at all times, including in the vicinity of hotels, airports, bus terminals, shopping
            malls and other public places. Do not display signs of affluence, such as jewellery,
            watches, cameras, phones, cash and bank or credit cards. Use only automated banking
            machines (ABMs) found in well-lit public areas or inside banks, and do so during the day
            only. Remain alert to your surroundings after using ABMs, and avoid carrying large sums
            of money. Avoid walking or travelling alone and after dark, particularly in and around
            the country’s two largest cities, Tegucigalpa and San Pedro Sula, as well as in
            Atlántida, Cortés, Colón, Yoro, Copán, Ocotepeque, Gracias a Dios and Olancho
            departments.

            Ensure that your personal belongings, passports and other travel documents are secure at
            all times. Carry photocopies of your travel documents, and leave the originals in a
            secure hotel safe.

            Narcotics smuggling and violence pose threats to the security of travellers in the
            northern departments of Colón, Gracias a Dios and Olancho, which are among the most
            violent departments in Honduras. Travellers in these areas should be particularly
            vigilant, as there have been incidents involving roadblocks and violence related to land
            disputes, particularly in the Aguan Valley in Colón and Yoro and in the north coast area
            near Trujillo.

            You should exercise caution at borders with Guatemala, El Salvador and Nicaragua and use
            official border points only. You should cross borders in the morning, as border
            crossings sometimes close unexpectedly early in the evening.

            The judicial and criminal investigation systems lack personnel, equipment and resources
            and have limited capacity to confront crime. You should exercise caution when dealing
            with police officers because corruption exists within parts of the police force.
            Demonstrations

            Occasional demonstrations and strikes addressing various grievances occur in the capital
            and in other cities and can cause significant traffic disruptions. In Tegucigalpa,
            demonstrations are known to target the National Congress, Central Park and Presidential
            House, and often transit along Suyapa Boulevard and Miraflores Boulevard. Avoid
            demonstrations and large crowds, as they can turn violent with little notice, and stay
            alert, exercise caution and keep informed of possible roadblocks.
            Landmines

            In 2004, Honduras concluded all planned projects related to the destruction of
            antipersonnel mines. No incidents involving landmines have been reported since 2012;
            however, you should still be cautious along the Honduras-Nicaragua border, especially in
            the Río Coco region, the Choluteca and El Paraíso departments and near the Atlantic
            coast. Restrict travel to major thoroughfares and authorized border crossings.
            Border crossing fees

            To avoid possible excessive charges at land border crossings, determine the correct fees
            from the embassy or consulate of each country you plan to visit before presenting
            yourself at a border crossing.
            Road travel

            Robberies and bus/carjackings occur along Honduran highways. Intercity public
            transportation should be avoided; if used, it is recommended to use companies that have
            direct, non-stop service from your place of departure to your destination. If driving,
            travel with heightened awareness along all routes. Plan your travel to depart and arrive
            within daylight hours and allow for possible traffic delays, which can include frequent
            car accidents along roads, slow moving trucks and overloaded vehicles, poorly maintained
            roads and high traffic volume in San Pedro Sula and Tegucigalpa.

            Armed robberies and assaults frequently occur along Route 41, the road from Limones to
            La Unión, Olancho, and northward via Yoro to Saba, Colón; within the Sula Valley in
            northern Honduras; and route 39 between Gualaco and Bonito Oriental, Olancho. Avoid
            roads that are in disrepair and travelling through isolated areas, including the road
            from El Porvenir, Francisco Morazán, to Yorita, Yoro; from Marcala, La Paz, to La
            Esperanza, Intibucá; and from Orocuina to Morolica, Choluteca. Travel with high caution
            en route to El Progreso, Tela, Trujillo and La Ceiba, and on the road through Santa
            Bárbara. Travelling on major roads between towns and cities is safer than travelling on
            secondary or remote routes.

            Heavy rains, flooding, landslides and bridge collapses have damaged many roads. Roads
            are often poorly delineated with inadequate lighting. Avoid driving at night, as
            vehicles often have poor lighting and animals and pedestrians commonly travel on roads
            after dark. Traffic accidents are a common cause of death and injury. Drivers involved
            in road accidents where another person is badly injured may be held in custody,
            regardless of culpability.

            The most dangerous stretches are from Tegucigalpa to Choluteca (winding two-lane
            mountain roads); from El Progreso to La Ceiba (animal crossings and poorly maintained
            bridges); and from Chamelecón (just south of San Pedro Sula) to Copán (winding and
            poorly maintained mountain road). Carry a phone in case of emergency and travel during
            daylight hours.

            Thieves are known to pose as victims of road accidents, so do not stop to attend to a
            body on the roadside; instead, report it at the next police point. Be cautious when
            approached by police, as gang members and criminals sometimes disguise themselves as
            police officers. Drive with windows closed and doors locked at all times. At roadblocks,
            establish the identity of the individuals stopping you before rolling down your window
            or opening your door.
            Public transportation

            Most urban public buses and shared taxis are poorly maintained and erratically driven.
            Accidents are common. There are regular incidents of individuals boarding a bus to rob
            all of the occupants and/or to shoot an occupant and/or the driver. A number of buses
            have being intentionally set on fire since 2013. Individuals travelling in shared taxis
            (colectivos) are regularly assaulted and robbed by thieves posing as occupants.

            For inter-city travel, use buses operated by private, well-established companies only.

            Use taxis from a reputable taxi service that provides non-stop service from your
            departure point to your destination. Never share a taxi with strangers. Note the
            driver\'s name and licence number, ensure that the driver does not pick up other
            passengers on the way to your destination, and agree on the fare in advance.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            Marine transportation

            In the area off the northeast coast of Honduras, armed assaults against private vessels
            have been perpetrated by criminals posing as fishermen. Sailors should contact local
            authorities for current information.
            General safety information

            Only undertake scuba diving and other adventure sports with a well-established company.
            If you have any doubt concerning the security of an installation or equipment, refrain
            from using them.
            Emergency services

            The emergency number for local police and all emergency services is 911. Police response
            to criminal incidents may be limited and delayed, and the Honduran police do not
            generally speak English or French.

            There are tourist police forces in Tegucigalpa, Roatán, La Ceiba, Copán, Tela, Choluteca
            and San Pedro Sula.

            Demonstrations

            Large-scale demonstrations took place in Hong Kong between September and December 2014.
            Hong Kong Police cleared all major protest sites in Admiralty, Causeway Bay and Mong Kok
            in mid-December 2014 following the grant of an injunction by the High Court. Avoid all
            demonstrations and large gatherings, follow the advice of local authorities and monitor
            local media.
            Crime

            The crime rate in Hong Kong is relatively low. Petty crime such as pickpocketing and
            purse snatching occurs, especially at the airport, on public transportation and in main
            tourist shopping areas, hotel lobbies and crowded streets. Bags left unattended are
            likely to be stolen. Ensure that your personal belongings, passports and other travel
            documents are secure at all times.

            Robberies, some targeting foreigners, have occurred in the shopping and entertainment
            districts in Shenzhen Special Economic Zone, located across the border from Hong Kong in
            mainland China’s Guangdong province. Be extremely vigilant while in Shenzhen, and travel
            with a friend or in a group. Carry copies of passports and other identification and a
            small supply of cash separate from your other personal belongings.

            Foreigners have been targeted in incidents of drink spiking, which is often combined
            with theft or credit card fraud. Never leave food or drinks unattended or in the care of
            strangers, and pay careful attention when drinks are being prepared and served.
            Transportation

            Traffic drives on the left and is congested in urban areas. Roads are narrow and
            frequently unmarked. Public transportation is widely available. Taxi drivers speak
            little or no English; you should therefore have your destination written in Chinese.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            Emergency services

            Dial 999.

            Crime

            Petty crime (pickpocketing, bag snatching) occurs, particularly at markets, on public
            transport, in railway stations, in shopping centres and in other areas frequented by
            tourists.

            Theft of passports also occurs. Safeguard personal belongings on overnight trains and
            lock your compartment door from the inside.

            Car thefts and highway robberies also occur. Drivers should be cautious when stopping at
            gas stations and highway parking areas, especially after dark.

            Another reported practice involves individuals staging roadside emergencies (for
            example, a smoking engine or flat tire) to persuade drivers to pull over. Thieves then
            remove personal belongings from the distracted driver\'s car.
            Demonstrations

            Demonstrations occur periodically in larger urban centres and have the potential to
            suddenly turn violent. Avoid all demonstrations and large gatherings, follow the advice
            of local authorities and monitor local media.

            Extremist groups have used national holidays, such as August 20 (St. Stephen’s Day),
            March 15 (date of the 1848 Hungarian Revolution) and October 23 (Republic Day) to stage
            demonstrations during commemorative events.
            Road safety

            Highways are generally in good condition. Rural roads may be narrow, badly lit and
            poorly maintained.

            Traffic congestion and parking in large cities can be a problem.
            Public transportation

            The bus and the metro are a reliable means of transportation. Fare payment on public
            transit is mandatory. Violators are subject to fines or arrest and prosecution.

            Only use officially marked taxis. Whenever possible, call a taxi through a dispatcher
            rather than hailing one on the street. Ensure that the meter is on and charging the
            appropriate rate, which should be displayed in the taxi. If you think you have been
            wrongly charged, take note of the taxi information, ask for a receipt and contact the
            taxi company to report the incident.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            Scams

            Some restaurants and clubs do not list prices, particularly in the business district of
            central Pest. Ask to see a menu with prices clearly listed. Avoid discussions regarding
            overcharging, as they could lead to violence.

            Some scams involve surcharges on final bills for drinks or meals. Travellers unable to
            pay the bill have been accompanied by the establishment’s security guard to a cash
            machine and forced to withdraw funds while being threatened. Do not ask taxi drivers to
            recommend bars or clubs, as they are sometimes accomplices in these scams.

            Male travellers have been approached by young women in public areas with invitations to
            socialize. Some have fallen victim to criminal activity and been presented with very
            large bills for drinks and entertainment.

            See Overseas Fraud for more information on scams abroad.
            General safety information

            Exercise normal security precautions. Ensure that your personal belongings, passports
            and other travel documents are secure at all times, especially on public transportation.
            Avoid showing signs of affluence and carrying large sums of cash.

            Carry adequate identification, such as your passport, at all times. Photocopies are not
            accepted. Keep a photocopy of your passport in case of loss or seizure.
            Emergency services

            Dial 112 for emergency assistance. The Hungarian Tourinform office offers tourism
            information and assistance 24 hours a day in English and German. They can be reached at
            +36 1 438 8080 and collect at +800 36 000 000.

            Crime

            The crime rate is low, but pickpocketing does occur. Be vigilant and pay attention to
            your surroundings at all times.
            Road travel

            Most roads in urban centres and national road no. 1 ("the ring road") are paved. Many
            inland roads are unpaved, narrow and lack shoulders. Roads in the highlands are only
            open during summer months. It is strictly forbidden to drive off tracks in the
            highlands.

            For up-to-date information on road and weather conditions, dial (+354) 522-1000 to reach
            the Icelandic Road Administration.
            Public transportation

            Rail service is not available in Iceland. Municipal bus services are generally not
            available outside Reykjavik and the surrounding towns. Ferries and long-distance buses
            operate throughout the country. Taxis are available in major cities and populated areas
            throughout the country.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            Natural attractions

            Exercise caution when visiting volcanic craters, glaciers, hot springs and other natural
            attractions, since there are few warning signs or barriers.
            Demonstrations

            Demonstrations occur occasionally and have the potential to suddenly turn violent. Avoid
            all demonstrations and large gatherings, follow the advice of local authorities and
            monitor local media.
            Trekking

            Trekkers and backpackers should not travel alone or venture off marked trails. If you
            intend to trek:

            a) never trek alone;

            b) always hire an experienced guide and ensure that the trekking company is reputable;

            c) buy travel health insurance that includes helicopter rescue and medical evacuation;

            d) ensure that you are in top physical condition;

            e) advise a family member or friend of your itinerary;

            f) know the symptoms of acute altitude sickness, which can be fatal;

            g) register with the Embassy, Consulate of Canada in Iceland; and

            h) obtain detailed information on trekking routes before setting out.

            Consult the website Safetravel.is (opens in new window) for advice from Icelandic search
            and rescue teams and to register your itinerary.
            General safety information

            Exercise normal safety precautions. Ensure that your personal belongings, passports and
            other travel documents are secure at all times. Never leave personal belonging
            unattended and never leave valuables in a car.

            Jammu and Kashmir (see Advisory)

            There are risks of civil disorder and acts of terrorism in many districts of Jammu and
            Kashmir, and the Indian army has been given special powers in this state. The prevailing
            security threat remains at a high level. There are sporadic violent clashes between
            militants and Indian security forces, and occasional terrorist attacks against Indian
            security forces, in the Kashmir valley and Jammu region of the state. Civilians have
            been killed or injured during such attacks. You could find yourself in the wrong place
            at the wrong time.

            Street demonstrations by the general public are easily triggered and can become violent;
            in the past, some have resulted in fatalities. Curfews and other mobility restrictions
            can be imposed by local authorities on short notice.

            A strong military presence remains on both sides of the Line of Control (the military
            control line between India and Pakistan). Unmarked border areas, landmines and
            unexploded munitions constitute a risk.
            Terrorism

            There is a continuing threat of terrorist attacks throughout India at all times,
            including attacks targeting public transportation and places frequented by foreign
            visitors and expatriates. Maintain a high level of vigilance, monitor local news
            reports, follow the advice of local authorities and avoid demonstrations and large
            gatherings. Exercise caution around tourist and religious sites, government
            installations and during public events such as cultural festivals. Be particularly
            vigilant during the Indian holiday period, which is between October and January, as well
            as in the lead-up to and during periods of national significance, such as Diwali,
            Republic Day (January 26) and Independence Day (August 15), as militants have used such
            occasions to mount attacks. If you see an unattended package, immediately leave the area
            and report the package to authorities.

            Terrorist attacks have occurred throughout India, often taking the form of remotely
            detonated bomb blasts in crowded markets of major centres at the peak shopping time, the
            early evening. On May 1, 2014, two explosions took place on a train arriving at the
            station in Chennai. Six explosions occurred in a park in Patna on October 27, 2013,
            where a large crowd had gathered for a political campaign rally. An explosion took place
            near the office of a political party in Bangalore on April 17, 2013. Two explosions
            occurred in a crowded neighbourhood in Hyderabad on February 21, 2013. Many people have
            been injured or killed as a result of these attacks.
            Insurgency

            Maoist extremist groups, known as Naxalites, are most active in areas identified by the
            Government of India as left-wing extremist states, which include Andhra Pradesh, Bihar,
            Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Odisha, Uttar Pradesh and West
            Bengal. Naxalites, who are responsible for more terrorist attacks in India than any
            other organization, are usually based in rural and forested areas within the left-wing
            extremist states. They mainly target government and security forces; in March 2012,
            however, two Italian citizens were kidnapped by Naxalites in Odisha State.

            There are frequent bombings and attacks by extremist groups in the northeastern state of
            Manipur. The Manipur-Burma, Assam-Bangladesh, Nagaland-Burma and Arunachal Pradesh-Burma
            border areas are also affected by insurgency. Trains and railway tracks are sometimes
            targeted. While tourists have not been specifically targeted, bystanders can be
            affected.
            Crime

            Petty crime, including pickpocketing and bag snatching, is common. Ensure that your
            passport and personal belongings are secure at all times, as passports and valuables
            have been stolen from luggage on trains and buses. Never leave food or drinks unattended
            or in the care of strangers. Be wary of accepting snacks, beverages, gum or cigarettes
            from new acquaintances, as they may contain drugs that could put you at risk of sexual
            assault and robbery.
            Women’s safety

            Reports of serious assault, rape and sexual aggression against foreign women have
            increased. Staring, vulgar comments and groping are not uncommon. Foreign women are
            often a target for unwanted attention. Avoid travelling alone, particularly at night, on
            public transportation, taxis and auto-rickshaws, as well as in less populous and unlit
            areas, including city streets, village lanes and beaches. Dress conservatively and
            respect local customs. Should you feel threatened, dial 100 (112 from cellular
            telephones) to reach police. See Her own way - a woman’s safe-travel guide for travel
            safety information for Canadian women.
            Fraud

            Scams involving the export of jewels and/or carpets have occurred. Taxi drivers may
            approach you offering money to export such items. Do not accept any offer, no matter how
            convincing. Beware of offers for cheap transportation or accommodation. See Overseas
            fraud: an increasing threat to the safety of Canadians for more information on scams
            abroad.
            Demonstrations, large gatherings and unrest

            Political rallies and demonstrations are frequent throughout the country and can turn
            violent, particularly around elections. Both domestic and international political events
            can trigger large-scale demonstrations that may include civil unrest. Curfews are
            occasionally imposed and significant disruptions to traffic and public transportation
            may occur.

            Inter-communal violence occasionally occurs, and can escalate and spread quickly.

            Stampedes have occurred during large gatherings at events, including religious
            ceremonies, resulting in deaths and injuries.

            Avoid all demonstrations and large gatherings, follow the advice of local authorities
            and monitor local media.
            Transportation

            Traffic drives on the left. Be very careful when crossing the street, even at pedestrian
            crossings. Travel by road is dangerous. Most roads, including major highways, are poorly
            maintained and traffic is congested. Drivers have little regard for traffic regulations
            and do not follow safe driving practices. After dark, avoid travelling outside urban
            centres as well as any travel by motorcycle or scooter. Use only officially marked
            taxis, pre-negotiate the far, and seek information from authorized service counters at
            airports or railway and bus stations. There is a possibility of mob anger when accidents
            cause serious injury. In such cases, remain in your vehicle and drive to the nearest
            police station to report the accident.

            The four land links between India and Pakistan are highly restricted. See the Travel
            Advice and Advisories for Pakistan if you plan on travelling to that country. Border
            crossings (road and rail) are open on a limited basis only, and travellers should
            inquire in advance.

            Rail accidents are common in India, mostly due to poor maintenance. Air and rail traffic
            in northern India is sometimes affected by cancellations and rescheduling in December
            and January, due to fog.

            Maritime accidents are also common and are often caused by poor safety practices. Do not
            board vessels that appear overloaded or unseaworthy.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            Piracy

            Pirate attacks occur in coastal waters and, in some cases, farther out at sea. Mariners
            should take appropriate precautions. For additional information, consult the Live Piracy
            Report published by the International Maritime Bureau.
            Trekking

            If you intend to trek:

            a) never trek alone;
            b) always hire an experienced guide and ensure that the trekking company is reputable;
            c) buy travel health insurance that includes helicopter rescue and medical evacuation;
            d) ensure that you are in top physical condition;
            e) advise a family member or friend of your itinerary;
            f) know the symptoms of acute altitude sickness, which can be fatal;
            g) register with the nearest Canadian government office in India; and
            h) obtain detailed information on trekking routes before setting out.
            Emergency services

            Dial 100 to reach police (112 from cellular telephones), 102 for ambulance and 101 for
            firefighters.

            Papua (see Advisory)

            Political tensions and violent incidents have increased since October 2011. In some
            cases, foreigners and foreign businesses have been targeted.

            In May 2012, a foreign tourist was shot in Jayapura without apparent motive. A series of
            random attacks causing casualties followed. A sharp increase in violent incidents was
            reported in June 2012.

            Police and military presence in Papua has been significantly increased following a
            series of violent incidents in Puncak Jaya. Labour disputes at the Freeport Indonesia
            mine near Timika, have led to demonstrations, transportation disruptions and violence.
            Fatal attacks have occurred on roads near the mine.

            Permits are required to travel to Papua. Entry regulations and permission to remain in
            Papua may change at any time. Demonstrations may turn violent and should be avoided.
            Seek local advice on your travel plans. Foreigners have been kidnapped and killed in the
            past.

            Several climbers of the Carstensz Pyramid (also known as Puncak Jaya or Jaya Kesuma) and
            surrounding areas in Papua have encountered significant difficulties travelling overland
            out of the area, resulting in unforeseen costs, delays and inconvenience. The Indonesian
            government regulates and approves permits to the Lorentz National Park, including the
            Carstensz Pyramid. Ensure that you have proper permits and have made arrangements for
            reliable and reputable guides prior to arrival. The only approved overland access is via
            a hiking trail from Illaga.
            Aceh

            You should only travel to Aceh with well-established and reputable organizations.
            Exercise caution at all times and in all places, and register and remain in contact with
            the Embassy of Canada in Jakarta. In the capital, Banda Aceh, there were sporadic
            attacks targeting foreigners in late 2009. Kidnappings for ransom, including of
            foreigners, have taken place in recent years. The latest reported incident was the
            abduction of a British citizen in the regency of East Aceh on June 11, 2013. Avoid
            travelling alone and travelling at night. Exercise particular caution on the road from
            Banda Aceh to Medan, where armed robberies have occurred.

            Religious police enforce sharia (Islamic law) in Aceh. Be aware that specific
            applications of sharia may differ by country and by region. Inform yourself of the
            relevant provisions specifically related to the region, regardless of your religion.
            Bali

            Terrorist attacks targeting foreigners and resulting in deaths and injuries took place
            in Bali in 2002 and 2005, and police disrupted an alleged terrorist cell in March 2012.
            Maintain a high level of personal security awareness at all times.
            Central Sulawesi

            Long-standing religious and social tensions remain in Central Sulawesi. Sectarian
            violence took place from 1998 to 2001 and from 2003 to 2006, especially in Poso, Palu
            and Tentena. The situation is now mostly calm, but the potential for violence remains.
            East and West Kalimantan

            The Philippines-based Abu Sayyaf group has kidnapped tourists from Sabah, Malaysia, and
            the Philippines. They have not extended their activities into neighbouring coastal areas
            of Indonesia, including East Kalimantan, but may be capable of doing so.

            Social tensions remain in West Kalimantan; however, no major conflict has taken place
            since communal violence ended in 2001.
            Maluku

            Long-standing communal tensions, including religious tensions, remain in the province of
            Maluku, especially in Ambon. Wide-spread violence occurred between 1999 and 2002, and
            there have been sporadic incidents since. Tensions between Christian and Muslim groups
            in Ambon resulted in clashes in late 2011. The situation is now mostly calm, but the
            potential for violence remains.
            North Sumatra

            Criminal activity targeting foreigners has increased in Medan, the capital of North
            Sumatra, in places frequented by tourists, such as hotels, and on public transportation.
            Several incidents involved either the threat or use of violence. Be aware of your
            surroundings and avoid showing signs of affluence.
            West Papua

            Political tensions and violent incidents have occurred in the past, and the potential
            for violence remains. Permits are required to travel to the province of West Papua.
            Consult the Regional Advisory for the province of Papua if you are planning to travel
            there.
            Terrorism

            On January 3, 2015, the US Embassy warned of a potential threat against US associated
            hotels and banks in Surabaya. Exercise a high degree of personal security awareness,
            maintain a heightened level of vigilance and be aware of your surroundings at all times.

            On September 21, 2014, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) released a
            statement threatening retaliation for the American-led coalition campaign against ISIL
            in Iraq and Syria. The statement encouraged opportunistic and indiscriminate attacks
            against citizens and interests of countries supporting the coalition, including
            Canadians. Individuals and terrorist groups in the region may be inspired to carry out
            attacks in a show of solidarity with ISIL. Canadians could also be targeted by a
            terrorist attack and be considered kidnapping targets. Exercise a high degree of
            personal security awareness, maintain a heightened level of vigilance and be aware of
            your surroundings at all times.

            There have been terrorist attacks in Jakarta and in Bali resulting in death and
            injuries. The most recent significant attacks occurred in 2009 in Jakarta when bombings
            occurred at two high-profile Western hotels. While effective counterterrorism measures
            by Indonesian authorities have reduced the risk of terrorist attacks, terrorist cells
            are still believed to exist and have the capacity to carry out attacks anywhere in the
            country.

            High-profile Western facilities or businesses and places frequented by foreigners may be
            considered potential terrorist targets. Exercise caution in choosing accommodations,
            places of worship, shopping venues, restaurants, clubs and tourist facilities. Opt for
            accommodation facilities with adequate security arrangements. Take bomb threats
            seriously.
            Crime

            Armed robberies are reported regularly and criminals are increasingly using weapons.
            Petty crime, including pickpocketing, bag snatching, and forced cash withdrawals from
            automated banking machines (ABMs), remains a serious concern. Keep car doors locked and
            windows rolled up at all times. Use reputable taxis from major hotels or book in advance
            by phone. Standards of police and legal services differ considerably from those in
            Canada. Be aware that, in some cases, police who stop motorists or others may request
            the immediate payment of fines.

            Never leave food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers. Be wary of accepting
            snacks, beverages, gum, or cigarettes from new acquaintances, as they may contain drugs
            that could put you at risk of sexual assault and robbery.
            Demonstrations

            Large and occasionally violent protests have taken place in many parts of the country
            over a wide range of issues. Sporadic ethnic and religious tensions in areas of
            Indonesia have resulted in violence and civil unrest.

            Avoid all demonstrations and gatherings, monitor local news and follow the advice of
            local authorities.
            Transportation

            Many remote parts of Indonesia have poor transport links, and departure from these areas
            may prove difficult or impossible in times of crisis.

            Road travel in Indonesia can be very challenging. Traffic drives on the left, driver
            discipline is poor, traffic rules are not consistently adhered to and streets are
            generally congested. Road conditions, particularly outside major centres, are
            substandard. Night driving in rural areas is dangerous, as most rural roads are unlit
            and some drivers do not use lights. If you plan to rent a car, consider hiring the
            services of a driver for a nominal additional fee.

            In the event of an accident, Indonesian law requires drivers to stop and exchange
            information and assistance. There is a possibility of mob anger if the accident has
            caused serious injury. In such cases, remain in your vehicle and drive to the nearest
            police station to report the accident.

            Motorcycle drivers and passengers are required to wear helmets. Motorcycle and scooter
            accidents are the main cause of death and serious injury among foreigners visiting many
            parts of Indonesia, including Bali.

            Transport by bus and rail can be crowded and safety standards differ from those in
            Canada.

            Avoid travelling by ferry. Maritime accidents are common and are often caused by poor
            safety practices or extreme weather conditions. Do not board vessels that appear
            overloaded or unseaworthy.

            The Indonesian Directorate General of Civil Aviation makes regular public releases of
            operational performance assessments of Indonesian commercial airlines. These reports
            have indicated that some local airlines do not maintain their aircraft to international
            maintenance and safety standards. In the past several years, a number of commercial
            aircraft have crashed in various parts of Indonesia, often as a result of failing to
            meet such aviation standards. In light of these sometimes fatal crashes and substandard
            practices, carefully evaluate implications for your safety before deciding to undertake
            domestic air travel.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            Swimming

            Rough seas and strong currents have led to drownings. Respect local warnings and consult
            hotel management about potential water hazards.
            Piracy

            Pirate attacks occur in coastal waters and, in some cases, farther out at sea. Mariners
            should take appropriate precautions. For additional information, consult the Live Piracy
            Report published by the International Maritime Bureau.
        </item>
        <item>
            Terrorism

            Heightened tensions throughout the region, together with increased threats globally from
            terrorism, may put you at greater risk. Maintain a high level of personal security
            awareness at all times as the security situation could deteriorate rapidly and without
            notice.
            Crime

            Violent crime affecting both Iranians and foreigners has increased. Petty theft occurs.
            Do not show signs of affluence. Ensure personal belongings, passports and other travel
            documents are secure, and carry a photocopy of your passport’s identification page at
            all times.

            Watch for fraudulent plainclothes police officers who may ask to see foreign currency
            and passports. If you are approached, politely decline to cooperate but offer to go to
            the nearest police station.
            Demonstrations

            Political demonstrations and gatherings occur. On several occasions, demonstrations
            resulted in violent clashes. People near demonstrations have been assaulted and deaths
            have been reported. Further incidents of political unrest may occur with little warning.
            Avoid all demonstrations and large gatherings, follow the advice of local authorities,
            and monitor local media.
            Women\'s safety

            Numerous cases have been reported of a Canadian or dual-citizen woman being stranded in
            Iran or mistreated by her Iranian husband or a male member of her family. Women in
            difficulty should know that the Government of Canada cannot intervene in family matters.

            There have been reports of physical and verbal harassment of women. Consult our
            publication entitled Her Own Way: A Woman’s Safe-Travel Guide for travel safety
            information specifically aimed at Canadian women.
            Border areas

            The regions of Sistan and Baluchestan (bordering Pakistan) are regularly affected by
            ethnic conflicts and there have been a number of kidnappings involving foreign tourists.
            Terrorist attacks may also occur in these regions.

            Bandits in border areas with Afghanistan and Pakistan are usually involved in drug
            trafficking and use kidnapping operations to secure the release of group members from
            prison.

            The region of Khuzestan (bordering Iraq) is regularly affected by ethnic conflicts and
            there have been a number of kidnappings involving foreign tourists.

            The borders with Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan are open only to citizens of those
            countries. Foreigners travelling in sensitive border areas (Azerbaijan, Khuzestan,
            Kurdistan, and Baluchistan) often attract the attention of local security forces, which
            can result in short periods of detention.

            If you decide to travel overland to Pakistan and Afghanistan despite this warning,
            travel only on main roads and in official parties, and avoid travelling after dark.
            Travel to Iraq

            The border with Iraq is usually closed. It can be opened on a case-by-case basis to
            allow the passage of certain foreigners or to allow refugees access to containment camps
            located on the Iranian side of the border.

            Before undertaking any trip to Iraq, read our Travel advisory for Iraq.
            Road travel

            Road conditions are good in cities, and the highway system is relatively well developed.
            Hire cars with a driver familiar with local conditions as driving standards are poor.
            Driving at night can be dangerous as streets are poorly lit and some motorists drive
            without headlights. Motorists routinely ignore traffic lights, traffic signs and lane
            markers, and almost never yield to pedestrians at crosswalks.

            In the event of a car accident, remain at the scene until authorities have made an
            official report.

            The use of four-wheel-drive vehicles is not recommended due to the high risk of theft.

            Hire only official taxis from agencies or hotel-based companies, and always
            pre-negotiate the fare. Most taxis do not have meters, and foreigners are often
            overcharged.

            Sidewalks on main roads in urban areas may be obstructed by cars. Sidewalks are rare in
            residential areas.
            Rail travel

            Trains are comfortable and punctual, but service is limited and slow.
            Sea travel

            The waters around the islands of Abu Musa and Tunbs in the southern Persian Gulf are
            politically sensitive and patrolled by the military. Foreigners navigating Iranian
            waters have been arrested and detained in the past.
            Air travel

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            General safety information

            Carry identification with you at all times. Leave a photocopy of your travel documents
            with a relative or a friend at home.

            Insurgency

            Following attacks on Mosul and other cities in northern Iraq, and threats of attack on
            Baghdad by extremists, the security situation in Iraq has become extremely volatile and
            could deteriorate with little or no notice.

            Extremist insurgents led by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, (ISIL) have
            threatened to push to Baghdad and regions further south. Attacks in KRG-controlled towns
            to the southwest of Erbil occurred in early August 2014. Following the start of targeted
            airstrikes against ISIL in northern Iraq by coalition forces, there are heightened
            threats of attacks against Western interests and of kidnapping Westerners.

            If you are currently in Iraq, consider departing by commercial means if it is safe to do
            so. Monitor local news reports and instructions from local authorities closely, and
            remain alert to your surroundings at all times.

            Since March 2013, the number and intensity of security incidents and sectarian-related
            violence have increased across Iraq. Popular targets include Iraqi security forces,
            government offices and large public gatherings.

            Potential Arab-Kurd violence is also of concern. Iraq’s internal stability is further
            undermined by the ongoing political situation, in which government officials compete for
            power along ethnic and sectarian lines.

            Car bombings, vehicle ambushes and mortar and rocket attacks occur periodically across
            the country, including in Baghdad and the International Zone (IZ) of Baghdad, resulting
            in numerous fatalities. These attacks are coordinated, and result in many casualties
            among bystanders. The risk of being in the wrong place at the wrong time remains high.

            Be extremely confident in your security arrangements, assess the risks of travelling in
            Iraq, monitor local developments closely and register with the Embassy of Canada to
            Jordan in Amman. Due to the unpredictable security situation, the Government of Canada’s
            ability to provide consular assistance in all parts of Iraq is severely limited.

            Curfews may be imposed on short notice.

            Armed clashes between Iraqi security forces and militants have been taking place in the
            province of Anbar since the beginning of 2014, with the most severe fighting
            concentrated in Fallujah and Ramadi. Numerous casualties have been reported and
            thousands of residents have fled the province.

            Sectarian violence and terrorist activity have increased since early 2013 in the
            provinces of Nineveh, Salaheddin and Diyala, including frequent improvised explosive
            device attacks.
            KRG-controlled provinces of Dahuk, Erbil and Sulaymaniyah

            Areas under KRG control have been less affected by violence and terrorism than other
            parts of Iraq, but nonetheless remain vulnerable to the impacts of both regional
            instability and internal tensions. Extremist insurgents led by ISIL are responsible for
            attacks on KRG-controlled areas, including towns southwest of Erbil. If you are in the
            Kurdistan region, you should take precautions to leave areas close to the conflict.
            Exercise a heightened level of vigilance and plan your security measures accordingly.

            Given the very volatile security situation, you may be refused entry into KRG-controlled
            areas from border points in Iraq.
            Threats to foreigners

            The threat to foreigners is very high; foreigners present a prime kidnapping target for
            criminal and terrorist groups hoping to extort money.

            Stay in secure, guarded accommodations, travel with close protection teams at all times
            and take all necessary security precautions if you decide to travel to Iraq. You are
            strongly advised to consider employing a professional security company and to adhere to
            their advice for the duration of your stay. You are also strongly advised to acquire
            comprehensive travel and medical insurance before travelling.
            Demonstrations

            Demonstrations and retaliatory attacks are common throughout the country, and typically
            result in deaths and injuries. There is greater unrest in the western and northern
            provinces due to ongoing Sunni protests and increased militant activity. Avoid all
            demonstrations and large gatherings, follow the advice of local authorities and monitor
            local media.
            Crime

            Crime and corruption are rampant. Carjackings and robberies are common. Security
            conditions deteriorate after nightfall in most areas. Violent conflicts involving
            organized criminal elements, street gangs, militant groups, rival militias and Iraqi
            security forces pose grave dangers.
            Checkpoints

            Security checkpoints have proliferated in Baghdad and in other parts of Iraq. Be very
            respectful and cooperate fully at security checkpoints. An Iraqi police or army uniform
            is not a guarantee that the wearer is operating in an official capacity. Exercise
            particular caution at ad hoc checkpoints, where murders, kidnappings and robberies
            frequently occur.Border areas

            Avoid travelling to border areas. Iraqi forces are attempting to contain the effects of
            the deteriorating security situation in Syria, and Kurdish rebel groups are frequent
            targets of military operations into Turkey and northwest Iran. You may encounter serious
            problems with local authorities when crossing porous borders.
            Women’s safety

            Consult our publication entitled Her Own Way: A Woman’s Safe-Travel Guide for travel
            safety information for Canadian women.
            Road travel

            Motorists frequently disobey traffic rules, including traffic lights, yielding to
            pedestrians at crosswalks and yielding the right of way. Speeding and tailgating are
            common practices.

            Due to the country’s high liability risk, it is difficult to obtain car insurance.

            Travel by road is not safe. Although travel at night is especially dangerous, attacks
            are also common during the day.

            The road leading to the Baghdad International Airport has been targeted by several
            attacks.

            Buses run irregularly and routes are subject to frequent changes. Rundown transit
            vehicles are frequently involved in accidents.
            Rail travel

            Avoid travelling by rail, as the railroad is old and poorly maintained.
            Air travel

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            General safety information

            Curfews may be imposed on short notice throughout the country. Monitor local media in
            order to stay informed of changes.

            Carry photo identification as well as a legally certified copy of your visa and
            registration at all times. Keep your passport and visa in safekeeping facilities.

            Telecommunications services are very poor or non-existent in remote areas. Cellular
            network coverage is widespread in major cities.
        </item>
        <item>
            Crime

            Petty crime (pickpocketing, bag snatching and stealing passports) occurs, particularly
            in areas frequented by tourists. Violent crime, although rare, occurs in larger cities.
            Avoid secluded parks and unlit areas.

            Car theft is on the rise, especially in Dublin; rental vehicles are especially targeted.
            Vehicles should be parked in secure parking lots.
            Demonstrations

            Demonstrations occur and have the potential to suddenly turn violent. They can lead to
            significant disruptions to traffic and public transportation. Avoid all demonstrations
            and large gatherings, follow the advice of local authorities and monitor local media.
            Scams

            Automated banking machine (ABM) card and credit card scams are becoming more common.

            See our Overseas Fraud page for more information on scams abroad.
            Public Transportation

            Taxis are widely available. The tariff structure counts time stopped in traffic as part
            of the fare. In Dublin, gridlock can prove expensive. Expect long delays during rush
            hours.

            Intercity bus and train services are occasionally affected by overcrowding and traffic
            congestion or disrupted by strike action.

            Ferry services are available between Ireland and the United Kingdom. Ferries can be
            delayed or cancelled due to weather conditions.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            General safety information

            Exercise normal safety precautions. Ensure that your personal belongings, passports and
            other travel documents are secure at all times. Avoid showing signs of affluence and
            carrying large sums of cash.
            Emergency services

            Rocket fire

            Cities across Israel may be targeted by rocket fire from the Gaza Strip. Rockets fired
            from Gaza have reached Jerusalem, Tel Aviv and Hadera, and have also struck close to
            Haifa, located approximately 150 km north of the Gaza border. Rocket fire from Lebanon,
            Egypt and Syria has also targeted northern Israel, Eilat and the Golan Heights. Follow
            safety advice and instructions from the Israel Defense Forces’ (IDF’s) Home Front
            Command.
            The Gaza Strip (see Advisory)

            From July to August 2014, the IDF carried out a military operation in the Gaza Strip,
            during which it conducted air strikes and a ground operation. Although a cease-fire was
            declared on August 27, 2014, hostilities could be renewed and the security situation in
            the Gaza Strip could deteriorate with little or no notice. Remain aware of your
            surroundings, stay informed of the security situation and follow directives from the
            IDF’s Home Front Command.

            Border areas with Israel are particularly dangerous. Border crossings to and from the
            Gaza Strip are controlled by Israeli and Egyptian authorities, and are subject to
            unexpected, sometimes long-term closures. You may not be able to exit the Gaza Strip
            even if you are in possession of valid entry and exit permits.

            There is a high risk of kidnapping in the Gaza Strip and foreigners may be targeted.
            Maintain a high level of vigilance at all times.

            The Government of Canada’s ability to provide consular services to Canadians who remain
            in the Gaza Strip is currently very limited.

            The security situation along the coast of Gaza remains dangerous and volatile. In May
            2010, an attempt to breach the naval blockade along the coast of Gaza was intercepted by
            Israeli security forces and resulted in deaths, injuries, arrests and deportations.
            Similar attempts to breach the naval blockade have taken place since. You are strongly
            advised against participating in any attempt to break the naval blockade. Canadian
            officials may not be able to provide you with consular assistance if you choose to
            participate in the flotilla. Participants may be detained by Israeli officials prior to
            their deportation. In cases of deportation, local authorities are not obliged to notify
            the Canadian embassy.
            Border with the Gaza Strip (see Advisory)

            From June to August 2014, rocket and mortar launches, gunfire and military activity
            increased significantly in the areas of Israel surrounding the Gaza Strip. Although
            rockets fired from Gaza can reach Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, Hadera and Haifa, cities and
            towns within 40 km of the Gaza Strip, such as Ashdod and Beersheva, are most likely to
            suffer material damages and casualties.
            Syrian Border (see Advisory)

            Do not travel east of Highway 98, except to the urban communities of Buq\'ata, Mas\'ada
            and Majdal Shams, and do not approach the Israeli barrier in the Golan Heights that
            borders Syria. Increased militant activity close to the Israeli barrier in the Golan
            Heights, including the use of improvised explosive devices, and attempts to penetrate
            the barrier from the Syrian side, make the area extremely dangerous. Cross-border
            gunfire could occur without warning, and the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) conduct
            military operations in the area.
            Regions of Israel bordering Egypt (see Advisory)

            The security situation could deteriorate rapidly and there is an increase threat of
            kidnapping, specifically on Highway 10 between the Sayarim Valley and the Kerem Shalom
            Border Crossing; and Highway 12 between Eilat and the Netafim Border Crossing.

            The highways are subject to closure without warning by Israeli authorities. Attacks
            occur and the area remains dangerous. The security situation has the potential to
            deteriorate at any time. There is an increased risk of kidnapping on these highways.
            Jerusalem

            Protests and demonstrations have become increasingly common in East Jerusalem and parts
            of the Old City, and many lead to clashes between protestors and local authorities.
            There is an increased police presence in some areas of Jerusalem, and security forces
            are on heightened alert. Exercise a high degree of caution at all times. Avoid all
            demonstrations and large gatherings, as they may turn violent without notice. Monitor
            news reports, and follow the advice of local authorities.

            During periods of imposed movement restrictions and religious holidays, as well as when
            national developments may have an impact on the local population, tensions may be
            exacerbated and lead to security incidents. Limit your movement to the Old City during
            such periods. Travel in groups and dress conservatively at all times. Demonstrations can
            occur in religious neighbourhoods and sometimes result in clashes between residents and
            the local police. Traffic may also be disrupted.
            West Bank, excluding Ramallah, Jericho and Bethlehem (see Advisory)

            Since early July, several West Bank cities have experienced violent demonstrations and
            civil unrest, which have led to clashes between police and protesters. The situation
            remains volatile. Maintain a high level of vigilance and personal security awareness,
            monitor local developments and follow the advice of local authorities.

            There is a potential for inter-factional tension, demonstrations and military operations
            in the West Bank. There are frequent police and military operations targeting militants
            in cities and villages throughout the West Bank, particularly in Nablus, Jenin,
            Qalqiliyya, Tulkarem and the refugee camps. It is not possible to travel without passing
            through multiple Israeli military checkpoints. There is a threat of demonstrations and
            violent outbreaks occurring in areas near checkpoints. Areas in the vicinity of the
            barrier separating the West Bank and Israel are particularly high-risk. Travel only
            during the daytime and do not stay overnight.

            In Hebron and in other parts of the West Bank, there remains potential for violence
            between settlers and Palestinians or between Palestinians and Israeli security forces.

            There is a high risk of kidnapping in the West Bank cities of Nablus and Jenin.
            Foreigners have been kidnapped in the past. Maintain a high level of vigilance at all
            times.

            If you are travelling to the West Bank despite this advice, ensure that you have
            appropriate security measures in place to protect yourself, as well as alternative
            travel arrangements in case of a rapid deterioration in the security situation. Carry
            your passport at all times, register and maintain contact with the Representative Office
            of Canada in Ramallah, keep a low profile, monitor local news reports and follow the
            advice of local authorities.
            Ramallah, Jericho and Bethlehem (West Bank)

            The level of violence in these three cities has remained relatively low compared to
            other areas of the West Bank in recent years. Nevertheless, the potential for political
            demonstrations and military incursions remains. Exercise a high degree of caution, avoid
            all demonstrations and large gatherings, follow the advice of local authorities and
            monitor local media.
            Northern Israel

            Exercise a high degree of caution when travelling to regions near the border with
            Lebanon. While a cessation of hostilities remains in effect between Israel and Hezbollah
            forces following the 2006 conflict, stability in the northern region of Israel could
            deteriorate rapidly without notice. Rockets fired from Lebanon into northern Israel have
            reached Shlomi and Kiryat Shmona. Although tensions have subsided since the 2006
            conflict, there is still a strong potential for future incidents.

            The security situation in the areas near the border with Syria is also unpredictable and
            could change without warning.
            Terrorism

            In past years, terrorist incidents have occurred in a variety of locations in Jerusalem,
            Tel Aviv, Eilat, Haifa, Beersheba, Netanya and other major populated centres, including
            at tourist sites, on public transportation and in other public areas, causing numerous
            deaths and injuries. Foreigners have been affected but have never been directly
            targeted. There is potential for further violence. Incidents could be unpredictable and
            there is a strong risk that you could find yourself in the middle of a dangerous
            situation.

            On October 22, 2014 pedestrians were run-over by vehicles in terrorist attacks near
            Light Rail stations in West Jerusalem, resulting in fatalities. On October 29, a man was
            shot outside a conference hall. Several other terrorist attacks in mid-November 2014
            caused fatalities in Jerusalem, the West Bank, and other parts of Israel. Such attacks
            are likely to continue. Five people were killed and several injured during a terrorist
            attack on a synagogue in West Jerusalem on November 18. On November 10, two knife
            attacks in Tel Aviv and the West Bank left a soldier and a civilian dead, as well as
            several wounded. The first stabbing took place outside the entrance to the Hagana train
            station in south Tel Aviv. A few hours later, a woman was stabbed to death and three
            others were badly wounded in a terrorist attack when a man drove into at a bus stop near
            the West Bank settlement of Gush Etzion, got out of his car and began randomly stabbing
            people. On December 3, a terrorist stabbed and seriously injured two people in a
            supermarket in the Mishor Adumim Industrial Park, east of Jerusalem. These incidents
            followed a spate of terror attacks in recent weeks. Rioting and stone and
            Molotov-cocktail throwing are on the rise in Jerusalem, the West Bank and in some
            Arab-Israeli villages.

            Police and security forces are on heightened alert. Exercise a high degree of caution
            when using public transportation, and after incidents of violence, public funerals and
            religious holidays, or when national developments may affect the local population.

            Following terrorist incidents, the Government of Israel may establish checkpoints
            without warning. Exercise caution in public places, such as open markets and bus
            stations, stay informed of the security situation, monitor local news reports and follow
            the advice of local authorities.
            Kidnapping

            There is a general threat of kidnapping. Maintain a high level of vigilance at all
            times.
            Crime

            The crime rate is moderate in Israel but low in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
            Vehicle theft is a serious problem. Always lock car doors and keep windows closed.
            Thefts also occur on public beaches. Ensure that your wallet, money and valuables are
            out of sight, particularly in large crowds and public markets. Violent crime is rare.
            Demonstrations

            Planned and unplanned demonstrations regularly occur in Israel, the West Bank and the
            Gaza Strip. Demonstrations against the military have taken place in the Gaza Strip, the
            West Bank and Jerusalem; some have turned violent. Exercise particular caution if
            demonstrations take place around areas such as settlements, checkpoints or military
            zones.

            Avoid crowds, political gatherings and demonstrations as they could turn violent without
            warning. Monitor news reports and follow the advice of local authorities.
            Landmines

            Live landmines are present in certain areas, including parts of the West Bank and along
            Israel’s borders. Some minefields have not been clearly marked or fenced. Walk only on
            established roads or trails.
            Transportation

            Exercise caution as there is a high rate of traffic fatalities. Consult the Israeli
            Police Traffic Department website for information on traffic laws.

            Exercise a high degree of caution when using public transport.

            Many of the roads in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank are of poor quality. During the
            winter months, precipitation can cause driving conditions to deteriorate.

            The Israel Defense Forces often do not permit vehicles with Israeli licence plates to
            enter areas of the West Bank. Even if you have a valid visa and authorization to enter
            the West Bank, there is still no guarantee that the vehicle will be allowed to pass
            through security checkpoints. You may also be stopped for security checks by Palestinian
            police within their jurisdiction. Vehicles bearing Israeli plates may be subject to
            attack in Palestinian areas.

            Vehicles with Palestinian licence plates are not permitted to enter Israel.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            General safety information

            Visitors, including dual nationals, should carry their passports at all times and
            register with the Embassy of Canada in Tel Aviv.

            There are frequent disruptions in telephone, power and water services in the West Bank
            and the Gaza Strip.

            Curfews may be imposed with little notice.
            Emergency services

            Crime

            The level of street crime is comparable to that of other European countries,
            particularly in large urban centres. Petty crime such as pickpocketing and purse
            snatching occur at tourist sites, on public transportation, and at major airports and
            railway stations. If possible, avoid carrying handbags. Motorcyclists frequently grab
            bags and other personal belongings from pedestrians, often resulting in injury.

            Isolated incidents of violence may occur in Italy, sometimes involving small-scale bombs
            and incendiary devices. These incidents have usually been carried out by criminal or
            extremist groups and directed at Italian institutions.

            Exercise caution and be alert while travelling by road and rail, as criminals target
            foreigners at gas stations, on highways, and on trains. Car theft occurs at gas stations
            and on highways. Keep a close eye on your vehicle when stopping at service areas.

            Keep your windows closed, bags and handbags out of reach, and doors locked at all times.
            Never leave personal belongings unattended in a vehicle and use secure parking
            facilities, especially overnight.

            Thieves often work in pairs or groups and will attempt to distract the victim while
            their accomplices rob them.

            Be especially vigilant when stopped at traffic lights, as bags are often snatched from
            passenger seats by thieves travelling on scooters.

            Rail passengers have been offered drugged food or drink and been robbed or assaulted
            while sleeping. Keep your compartment door securely locked.

            The number of lost and stolen passports increases during the summer months. To prevent
            loss or theft, exercise caution and carry a photocopy of your passport, rather than the
            original.
            Demonstrations

            Avoid demonstrations and large gatherings as they can turn violent without notice.
            Strikes

            Transportation strikes regularly affect services of the national airline, railways, city
            bus lines and taxis. Plan alternate travel arrangements and regularly check with
            transportation providers for any schedule changes. Monitor local news and follow the
            advice of local authorities.
            Spiked food and drinks

            Never leave food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers. Be wary of accepting
            snacks, beverages, gum or cigarettes from new acquaintances. Drugs may be present that
            could put you at risk of assault and robbery. Incidents of this sort have occurred even
            in small towns known to be frequented by tourists.
            Fraud

            Fraudulent electronic readout devices are being used at automated banking machines
            (ABMs) in Italy. These devices are designed to capture the account information stored on
            the card’s magnetic strip through a card reader fixed over the legitimate reader. The
            customer’s PIN is recorded with a small video camera installed above the keypad. The
            victim’s banking information is then sold or traded online. To avoid being a victim of
            this fraud, use ABMs located in well-lit public areas or inside a bank or business,
            avoid card readers with an irregular aspect, cover the keypad with one hand when
            entering your PIN, and check any unauthorized transactions on your account statements.

            See our Overseas fraud page for more information on scams abroad.
            Road travel

            City streets are often narrow, winding and congested. Motor scooters and other vehicles
            are often driven recklessly. Lane markings are frequently non-existent, and traffic
            lights are limited and often ignored. Numerous accidents are caused by excessive
            speeding on highways and rural roads.

            Pay close attention to road conditions and refrain from driving during or immediately
            after severe storms. Monitor local news and follow the advice and warnings issued by
            local authorities.

            In northern Italy, be aware of ground fog and poor visibility, especially in winter.
            Public transportation

            Only use officially licensed taxis equipped with roof lights and meters. If you call a
            radio taxi, be aware that the meter starts to run as soon as the cab leaves to pick you
            up.

            Rail service is widely available. Ferry services are available to Greece, North Africa
            and local islands (for example, Sicily, Sardinia, Capri, Ischia and Elba).

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            Mountain activities

            If you intend to do mountaineering or ski touring:

            a) never practice these activities alone;

            b) always hire an experienced guide from a reputable company;

            c) buy travel health insurance that includes helicopter rescue and medical evacuation;

            d) ensure you are in top physical condition;

            e) advise a family member or friend of your destination, your itinerary and when you
            expect to be back;

            f) know the symptoms of acute altitude sickness, which can be fatal;

            g) register with the Embassy of Canada in Italy; and

            h) obtain detailed information on trekking routes or ski slopes before setting out, and
            do not venture off established trails, especially in early or late winter.
            General safety information

            Pay attention to your surroundings. Avoid showing signs of affluence and carrying large
            sums of cash.

            Ensure that your personal belongings, passports and other travel documents are secure at
            all times. Never travel with your passport and proof of Canadian citizenship (birth
            certificate or Canadian citizenship certificate) in the same bag or pouch. Keep a
            photocopy of your passport in case of loss.

            Crime

            Violent crime (armed robbery, murder) and petty theft (pickpocketing, bag snatching)
            occur, particularly in Kingston, Spanish Town and in Montego Bay. Although the presence
            of security and anti-crime troops has intensified in major urban areas, drug- and
            gang-related violence, including shootings, continues to be a significant problem and
            can result in death, injury and destruction of property. There is a constant risk of
            becoming the victim of crossfire. Police may impose curfews with short notice in areas
            where gang activity is a concern. Maintain a high level of personal security awareness
            at all times, follow the advice of local authorities and monitor local media.

            Some areas in Kingston, mainly inner-city and poor neighbourhoods, have high incidences
            of crime and should be avoided, such as: Whitfield Town, Payne Land, West Kingston,
            Grant\'s Pen, August Town, Denham Town, Hannah Town, Arnett Gardens, Tivoli Gardens and
            Olympic Gardens, Harbour View, Central Village, Spanish Town, Mountain View, Trench
            Town, Cassava Piece, Canterbury, Norwood, and Rose Heights. You should also avoid some
            parts of Montego Bay, namely St. Clavers Avenue and Hart Street, Flankers and Mount
            Salem (except for the resort areas).

            Do not walk alone. Exercise particular caution after dark, and avoid visiting beaches or
            using buses at night. If you are a victim of crime, do not resist, as this may provoke
            the use of violence.

            Never leave food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers. Be wary of accepting
            snacks, beverages, gum, or cigarettes from new acquaintances, as they may contain drugs
            that could put you at risk of sexual assault and robbery.

            Although most hotels and resorts are well guarded, always ensure that your hotel room
            doors and windows are secure. There have been a number of incidents recently in large
            resorts involving theft from hotel room safes by hotel staff. Travellers should enquire
            with reception upon check-in on security precautions related to theft from hotel rooms.
            Vigilance is recommended when staying in smaller or isolated establishments with less
            security. Compounds that are gated and guarded are considered the safest accommodations
            in the Kingston area.

            Ensure that your personal belongings and travel documents are secure at all times. Do
            not show signs of affluence or carry large sums of money, and be aware of your
            surroundings when withdrawing money from automated banking machines (ABMs). Remain
            vigilant at supermarkets and retail outlets, as credit card and ABM fraud is increasing
            in Jamaica.
            Road travel

            Traffic drives on the left. Coastal roads are in fair condition, but driving in the
            interior is dangerous due to narrow, winding and poorly maintained roads, which are also
            poorly lit at night. Weather conditions can damage or render some roads temporarily
            impassable. Stay on main roads as much as possible.

            Speeding and driving under the influence of alcohol are common. Motorists should keep
            vehicle windows closed and doors locked. Roadside assistance is available island wide.

            When driving between Norman Manley International Airport and Kingston, take the South
            Camp Road (also known as the Humming Bird Route) rather than Mountain View Avenue, which
            can close on short notice.
            Public transportation

            Public transportation is not safe due to high levels of crime and overcrowding.

            Knutsford Express offers reliable and comfortable bus transportation between major
            towns.

            Use only taxis ordered from hotels and authorized by the Jamaican Union of Travellers
            Association (JUTA). These are identified by red-and-white “PP” licence plates and a lime
            green JUTA sticker on the window. Since taxis are not metered, agree on the fare in
            advance.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            Emergency services

            Dial 119 to reach the police emergency centre and 110 to reach the fire department and
            ambulance services.

            Police officers regularly patrol tourist areas and can offer assistance. Security
            personnel and front-desk hotel staff can also offer assistance in most emergencies.

            Visitor information booths and Jamaica Tourist Board offices are located throughout the
            island. They offer various services to visitors, including direct radio links with local
            police and information on safe public beaches. These offices are located at:

            - Montego Bay: Cornwall Beach, Gloucester Avenue: tel. 876-952-4425, -4426, -4427, or

            March 2011 earthquake

            On March 11, 2011, a strong earthquake measuring 9.0 on the Richter scale occurred in
            the North Pacific Ocean, generating a powerful tsunami that struck the Pacific coast of
            Japan. The situation has returned to normal in most parts of the country; however,
            reconstruction efforts are ongoing in those areas of Iwate, Miyagi, Fukushima and
            Ibaraki prefectures most affected by the earthquake and tsunami, and some transportation
            routes may not be operational, especially along the Pacific coast. Before you travel to
            these areas, ensure that you have secured accommodation and transportation, and follow
            the advice of local authorities.
            Crime

            Crime against foreigners is low. Petty crime occurs on occasion. Crime may be more
            frequent in large cities, particularly in entertainment districts (see below).
            Inappropriate touching often occurs in busy subway and commuter trains during morning
            and evening commuting hours.

            Exercise caution in all entertainment and nightlife districts throughout Japan and
            especially in Tokyo’s Roppongi, Shinjuku, Shibuya and Ikebukuro areas. Foreigners are
            increasingly targeted in incidents of drink spiking, which can be combined with credit
            card fraud and physical or sexual assault. Never leave your drink unattended and pay
            attention when drinks are prepared and served. If possible, avoid carrying credit cards
            when frequenting nightclubs in any entertainment district. Foreigners have reported
            being overcharged at bars and clubs.
            Transportation

            Traffic drives on the left. Travel by motor vehicle is challenging: roads are narrow,
            signs are in Japanese and city traffic is congested. Do not turn on a red light unless
            it is specifically authorized. Roads in mountainous areas are often closed during
            winter.

            Have your destination written in Japanese if you travel by taxi as drivers may not
            understand English.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            Emergency services

            Dial 110 to reach police and 119 for firefighters and ambulance.

            Tourists and foreign residents may obtain assistance (in English) via telephone
            hotlines. The Tokyo English Lifeline provides counselling and referrals (tel.
            03-5774-0992). Additional referrals may be obtained from the Embassy of Canada to Japan
            in Tokyo.

            Areas within 3 km of the border with Syria (see Advisory)

            Clashes involving small arms and mortar fire have occurred in the areas bordering Syria,
            a direct result of spill over from the ongoing conflict in that country.
            Terrorism

            On September 21, 2014, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) released a
            statement threatening retaliation for the American-led coalition campaign against ISIL
            in Iraq and Syria. The statement encouraged opportunistic and indiscriminate attacks
            against citizens and interests of countries supporting the coalition, including
            Canadians. Individuals and terrorist groups in the region may be inspired to carry out
            attacks in a show of solidarity with ISIL. Canadians could also be targeted by a
            terrorist attack and be considered kidnapping targets. Exercise a high degree of
            personal security awareness, maintain a heightened level of vigilance and be aware of
            your surroundings at all times.

            There is a general terrorist threat throughout Jordan. From time to time, reports emerge
            that terrorists plan to attack specific locations in countries of the Arabian Peninsula.
            Targets could include government buildings, public areas, tourist sites, and Western
            interests. Security measures are currently in place and may be reinforced upon short
            notice. Maintain a high level of vigilance and personal security awareness at all times,
            exercise caution in areas known to be frequented by foreigners (commercial, public,
            tourist), monitor local developments and follow the advice of local authorities.
            Demonstrations

            Civil unrest and demonstrations, some of which have turned violent, have been taking
            place since January 2011. Demonstrations are more likely to occur on Fridays, after noon
            prayer. Locations where demonstrations have taken place include the Al-Huseini Mosque in
            downtown Amman, King Hussein Park, Duwar A-Dakheliya and Jamal Abdel Nasser Square.
            Avoid all demonstrations and large gatherings, follow the advice of local authorities
            and monitor local media.
            Crime

            The crime rate is low by regional standards, but petty crime occurs, especially in
            downtown Amman. Stay away from crowded areas. Do not show signs of affluence and keep
            your personal belongings, passports and other travel documents secure at all times.

            Carjacking attempts have been reported in Amman. Victims are usually lured out of their
            car as the result of a minor collision or by another car blocking their route. If you
            are involved in an accident in an isolated area, stay in your car and call the police.
            Transportation

            Accidents are quite common. Driving habits and styles differ markedly from those
            practised in Canada. Driving during daylight is preferable. Roaming animals and
            insufficient lighting pose hazards after dark.

            If a pedestrian is injured in an accident, the driver is always considered guilty and
            may face imprisonment and heavy fines.

            If you are involved in an accident, try to make financial arrangements with other
            involved drivers. In the event of traffic accidents resulting in personal injuries,
            police should be involved. In the event of traffic accidents resulting in personal
            injury, regardless of fault, drivers may be held for several days until responsibility
            is determined and restitution made.

            Off-road driving can be hazardous and should only be undertaken in a convoy of
            four-wheel-drive vehicles with an experienced guide. Leave a travel itinerary with a
            family member or friend. Be well prepared and equipped with gasoline, water, food and a
            cellular phone.

            Public transportation is usually very crowded and can be uncomfortable.

            Cleanliness and mechanical reliability of taxis varies considerably. Book taxis through
            hotels.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            Women’s safety

            There have been a number of reports of sexual harassment and assaults. Women should
            dress conservatively, travel in groups and in daylight. When taking a taxi, women should
            sit in the back seat. Consult our publication entitled Her Own Way: A Woman’s
            Safe-Travel Guide for travel safety information for Canadian women.
            Border areas

            Landmines and unexploded munitions are still a danger near military installations and
            borders, including the Dead Sea area. Minefields are usually fenced and marked, but
            could be difficult to see. Do not touch suspicious or unfamiliar objects.

            Exercise caution at the borders with Israel and Iraq, especially if using service taxis
            when crossing the borders. These borders may close on short notice.

            Exercise a high degree of caution near and in refugee camps, as well as at border areas.
            General safety information

            Carry identification documents at all times. Leave your passport in a safe place and
            carry a photocopy for identification purposes.

            Avoid travelling alone in remote areas.
            Emergency services

            Dial 911 for police, medical services and the fire department.

            Terrorism

            There is a general threat of terrorism in Kazakhstan, particularly in the western and
            southern regions. Maintain a high level of vigilance and follow the advice of local
            authorities.
            Crime

            Violent crime against foreign tourists occurs. Robberies occur on public transportation,
            in parks, shopping areas, open markets and restaurants, and near major tourist hotels
            and nightclubs. Do not open your door to strangers under any circumstance. Do not carry
            large amounts of money or travel alone after dark.

            Foreigners have been robbed by individuals posing as police officers. If approached, ask
            to see police credentials.

            Men posing as “meet and greet” airport facilitators lure unsuspecting foreigners into
            cars and demand money. Make prior arrangements with your contacts so they can
            appropriately identify themselves to you at the airport.

            Do not accept food or drinks from strangers. Do not leave your food or drinks unattended
            in bars or restaurants. Cases of drugging followed by robbery have occurred.

            At night, call a reputable taxi service before you leave popular restaurants and places
            of recreation, as foreigners have been specifically targeted leaving such venues.
            Demonstrations

            Demonstrations, though rare, occur and have the potential to suddenly turn violent. They
            can lead to significant disruptions to traffic and public transportation. Avoid all
            demonstrations and large gatherings, follow the advice of local authorities and monitor
            local media.
            Road travel

            Poor driving, poorly lit and maintained roads, and obscure signs and regulations make
            driving hazardous, especially in winter. Driving after dark is dangerous. The Cyrillic
            alphabet is used on road signs.

            Hire a car with a driver.

            Buy gas before leaving major cities because there are few gas stations in rural areas.

            Use only officially marked taxis, pre-negotiate the fare and do not allow other
            passengers to ride with you.

            Routine and strict border controls on the road between Almaty, Kazakhstan, and Bishkek,
            Kyrgyzstan, are in place, making travel in this region more difficult. Strict adherence
            to visa regulations is essential.
            Rail travel

            While rail service is good, robberies often occur and railroad officials may be
            involved. Store your belongings in a safe place and do not leave the compartment
            unattended. Ensure that the door is secured from the inside.
            Air travel

            Unannounced delays and flight cancellations are common in winter due to poor weather
            conditions. Reservations on regional airlines are not always respected.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            General safety information

            Identification checks are common and police arrest visitors who do not carry
            identification. Carry photo identification as well as a legally certified copy of your
            visa and registration with you at all times. Keep your passport and visa in a safe place
            and leave a photocopy of your travel documents with a relative or a friend at home.

            Radioactive or toxic chemical sites associated with former defence industries and test
            ranges, particularly in the Semipalatinsk Test Site area, pose health risks. These test
            areas are normally closed to foreigners; if travelling to these areas on organized
            tours, closely follow the advice of tour leaders.

            Tourist facilities are limited, especially outside Almaty and Astana.
            Emergency services

            Dial 101 for the police, 102 for fire and 103 for an ambulance.

            Areas bordering Somalia (see Advisory)

            Although Kenya’s border with Somalia is closed, it is porous and Somali militias and
            bandit groups have carried out cross-border attacks against foreigners and humanitarian
            workers in this region. Some of these incidents involved the use of improvised explosive
            devices (IEDs) and have resulted in injuries and deaths, including at the Dadaab Refugee
            Camp, 80 km from the Somali border. The risk of such attacks in the region remains high.
            Disputes between Somali clans also make the region unstable and dangerous. Kenyan
            efforts to restrict Somali incursions and gun-running have curtailed travel to the
            northern areas near the Somali border.

            On April 2, 2015, an attack against Garissa University College killed at least 140
            people and injured many more. A dusk-to-dawn curfew is in effect in Garissa, Wajir,
            Mandera and Tana River Counties.

            Beachfront accommodations and boats off the coast are particularly vulnerable to
            attacks. Since June 2014, groups of gunmen have attacked several areas along the coast
            of Lamu county. On July 11, 2014, more than 40 people died and buildings were burned
            during a raid in the village of Pandanguo. On June 15, 2014, gunmen attacked the town of
            Mpeketoni, including two hotels, killing at least 48 people.

            A 6:30 p.m. to 6:30 a.m. curfew is in effect for mainland areas of Lamu County.
            Eastleigh neighbourhood of Nairobi (see Advisory)

            There are heightened tensions in Nairobi’s Eastleigh neighbourhood, where a series of
            explosions has occurred since late November 2012. Several people have been killed, and
            many more have been injured.
            Mombasa (see Advisory)

            There have been occasional reports of violent demonstrations and rioting in Mombasa,
            most recently following the killing of a prominent Mombasa cleric on April 1, 2014.

            In July 2014, two foreigners were killed near Fort Jesus in Mombasa.

            There have been a number of attacks, possibly linked to terrorist groups, in Mombasa
            since 2013. On May 3, 2014, at least four people were killed when an explosive device
            was thrown at a bus, while another device exploded near a public beach bar without
            causing casualties. On March 22, 2014, many people were killed in an attack on a church
            in the Likoni area of Mombasa. On March 17, 2014, police in Mombasa found large
            quantities of weapons and explosives in a car. Kenyan authorities seem to believe that
            there are more similar explosive devices in the wider region. There were reports, on
            December 12, 2013, of an attempted grenade attack targeting the vehicle of two tourists
            in Likoni. On January 2, 2014, several people were injured in a grenade attack at a
            nightclub in Diani, near Mombasa. Further attacks cannot be ruled out. Remain vigilant
            at all times, avoid large gatherings, monitor local media and follow the advice of local
            authorities.
            Northern Kenya

            Some areas located north of the Kitale–Samburu–Garissa line in northern Kenya are
            considered unsafe. The ongoing threat posed by terrorism is joined by various regional,
            tribal or clan-based conflicts involving land, cattle and water. Use armed escorts when
            travelling to or from this region. Armed escorts are available from local police
            stations and it is advisable to contact them before undertaking any journey. Avoid
            venturing away from tourist areas and refrain from travelling after dark.
            Western Kenya

            Tribal conflicts have occurred in the Mount Elgon area of western Kenya. If you decide
            to travel to that region, remain vigilant at all times and monitor local media.
            Terrorism

            There is a high threat from terrorism throughout Kenya, including in Nairobi and
            Mombasa. We continue to receive information indicating that terrorists may be planning
            attacks against a range of targets in Kenya, including in Nairobi and Mombasa.

            On March 26, 2015, the Australian government indicated that: " Current information
            suggests that terrorists may be planning attacks against crowded locations in Nairobi in
            the near future."

            Regional terrorist groups, including al Qaeda and al-Shabaab, continue to threaten
            Western interests and other potential targets in Kenya. In recent years, terrorist
            attacks have occurred in busy public venues, including in places of worship. Since the
            latter half of 2013, al-Shabaab has demonstrated both the intent and capability to
            conduct terrorist attacks in the region with increasing frequency and sophistication.
            Terrorist attacks could occur at any time and could target areas frequented by
            expatriates and foreign travellers, such as Western embassies, United Nations’ premises,
            restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets, hotels, tourist resorts,
            safari lodges, international schools, places of worship and airports and other
            transportation hubs. They could also target areas where government offices are
            concentrated, such as Nairobi Central Business District. Attacks could take the form of
            suicide operations, grenade attacks, roadside or vehicle-borne IEDs and attacks on civil
            aviation or on maritime vessels near Kenyan ports. Avoid all nightclubs, avoid visiting
            businesses during peak hours and steer clear of large crowds. Be extremely vigilant when
            driving on high-volume traffic roads and at intersections near areas frequented by
            expatriates, especially at peak times.

            Two explosions occurred in Nairobi on May 16, 2014, one targeting a matatu (minibus)
            near the downtown core and a second at Gikomba Market; casualties were reported. On May
            4, 2014, near-simultaneous explosions occurred on buses travelling on the outskirts of
            Nairobi; at least three people were killed and dozens were injured. An explosion was
            reported at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA) in Nairobi on January 17,
            2014. Be particularly vigilant at all airports.

            Be particularly vigilant during religious holidays and other public celebrations, as
            militants have used such occasions to mount attacks.

            You should be very cautious if attending sporting events, such as football matches.
            Avoid public venues such as sports bars, night clubs and restaurants that broadcast
            these games, as well as public transportation, such as taxis, to and from the events. Be
            extremely vigilant in crowded places and monitor local media.
            Crime

            There is a high crime rate in most regions of Kenya, particularly in major cities such
            as Nairobi, Mombasa and Kisumu, and at coastal beach resorts. There has been a sharp
            increase in crime in Nairobi since March 2014, with carjackings, home invasions and
            kidnappings occurring even in neighbourhoods normally deemed safe and during daylight
            hours.

            Exercise extreme caution in the Kibera, Kasarani, Mathare and Eastleigh neighbourhoods
            of Nairobi.

            Petty crimes, such as purse-snatchings and robberies, occur frequently in other major
            towns (Mombasa, Kisumu, Nakuru) and coastal beach resorts. Criminals and swindlers have
            been known to impersonate hotel employees, police officers or government officials. When
            you leave your hotel room, ensure that the door is locked and the “do not disturb” sign
            is displayed. Store your personal belongings in safekeeping facilities. You should
            absolutely avoid walking or travelling after dark, and exercise caution while walking
            during daylight hours. Avoid showing signs of affluence or carrying large sums of money.
            Be aware that cases of “mob justice” are regularly reported, in which crowds lynch
            suspected criminals prior to the arrival of police.
            Airports

            Tourists have recently been the target of carjackings, robberies and kidnappings while
            travelling to or from the International airports in Nairobi and Mombasa. When arriving
            at these airports, you should only use transportation organized by reputable tour
            companies or well-marked taxis. Be particularly vigilant if you are commuting alone.

            Airport authorities at the Jomo Kenyatta International airport (JKIA) recommend that
            travellers arrive at least three hours before their flight. Cases of passport theft have
            been reported in the departure area of JKIA. Currency should not be exchanged in the
            public areas of the airport. Checked luggage may be pilfered at the airport. Store
            valuables in locked hand-luggage. Be particularly vigilant at all airports.
            Demonstrations

            Demonstrations occur and have the potential to suddenly turn violent. Avoid all
            demonstrations and public gatherings, follow the advice of local authorities and monitor
            local media.
            Women’s safety

            Women travelling on their own should remain particularly vigilant, as attacks involving
            sexual assaults, including against foreigners, are regularly reported, even though
            Nairobi has an anti-rape awareness campaign. See Her Own Way: A Woman’s Safe-Travel
            Guide for travel safety information for Canadian women.
            Non-governmental organizations

            Foreigners volunteering with local non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have reported
            incidents of fraud, threats and mistreatment by local personnel. Volunteers have been
            left stranded when the illegitimate NGOs they were working for closed.

            If you are contemplating volunteer work with NGOs in Kenya, you should contact the
            National Council of NGOs, before making any commitment and before departing Canada, to
            confirm that the organization you wish to work with is legitimate. All NGOs in Kenya are
            required by law to be registered with the National Council of NGOs, a self-regulating,
            non-partisan body.

            See Entry/Exit Requirements for information on work permits required to work for an NGO
            or to volunteer.
            Road travel

            Traffic drives on the left. Excessive speeds, unpredictable driving habits and frequent
            drunk driving (especially at night), lack of adequate street lighting and poorly
            maintained vehicles pose hazards. Furthermore, road conditions are poor. During the
            rainy season, some unpaved roads are impassable, even with four-wheel drive vehicles.
            You should drive defensively, and keep the doors locked and windows closed at all times.
            The road from Nairobi to Mombasa is congested and can be dangerous for tourists
            unfamiliar with local driving conditions. You should consider air travel. Use authorized
            border crossings when travelling by vehicle between Kenya and Tanzania.
            Public transportation

            Public transportation is unsafe. Long-distance buses have been involved in a number of
            serious accidents. Matatus are generally poorly maintained, recklessly driven and are
            often without adequate insurance coverage. Incidents of matatus being hijacked or
            passengers being robbed have been reported. Use only hotel taxis, and confirm the fare
            in advance. Passenger trains are not safe and are routinely late.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            National parks, safaris and reserves

            Most visits to national parks, game reserves and other popular tourist destinations in
            Kenya remain incident free. However, foreign tourists, including Canadians, have been
            victims of crime, sometimes involving violence. Remain aware of your surroundings at all
            times. Avoid camping alone or without expert local assistance.

            Tourist facilities are widely available in Nairobi, on the coast, in game parks and in
            wildlife reserves, but are non-existent in the regions bordering South Sudan, Somalia
            and Ethiopia.

            Visitors travelling overland to certain game parks and reserves have been attacked by
            armed bandits. The route from Malindi to Lamu can also be dangerous. There have been
            rare reports of attacks or robberies of travellers on the roads between Nairobi and the
            Masai Mara, Amboseli, Nakuru and Tsavo game parks/reserves and the Mount Kenya/Aberdares
            area. However, there have been periodic hijackings, robberies and attempted robberies on
            the main road between Nairobi and the Tanzanian border, the road that also serves as the
            route to Kenya’s Amboseli National Park.

            There are inherent risks associated with viewing wildlife, particularly on foot or at
            close range. Always maintain a safe distance when observing wildlife and avoid exiting
            vehicles unless it is deemed safe to do by professional guides and wardens. Use only
            reputable and professional guides or tour operators and closely follow park regulations
            and wardens’ advice.

            The Kenya Tourism Federation operates the Safety and Communication Centre, which
            provides the latest information on tourism and road conditions, and assistance in an
            emergency. You can obtain information by calling the centre in Nairobi at +254 (0)
            20-6004-767 or emailing to safetour@wananchi.com.
            Piracy

            Pirate attacks occur in coastal waters and, in some cases, farther out at sea. Mariners
            should take appropriate precautions. For additional information, consult the Live Piracy
            Report published by the International Maritime Bureau.
            Fraud

            Cases of attempted fraud are frequently reported in this country. See Overseas Fraud for
            more information.
            General security information

            Local authorities are increasingly checking identification papers. Carry your passport
            with you at all times, and cooperate with authorities should you be questioned.

            Maintain a high level of personal security awareness at all times and in all places.
            Take appropriate security measures, particularly on roads linking a city centre to
            residential areas, and refrain from travelling at night. Victims of attacks are advised
            not to offer resistance. Monitor local developments, register with the Registration of
            Canadians Abroad (ROCA) service and follow the messages issued through the service.

            Crime

            Petty crime occurs. Ensure that your personal belongings, passports and other travel
            documents are secure at all times.
            Transportation

            Traffic drives on the left. Roads in Tarawa and Christmas Island are poor. Some roads
            regularly flood after heavy rains. Be extremely careful when driving at night due to
            limited street lighting.

            Passenger ferries go to many of the smaller islands, however carefully consider taking
            local ferry services due to overcrowding and limited safety precautions onboard.

            The main islands have airstrips and are served from Tarawa.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            General safety information

            You are encouraged to register with the High Commission of Australia in Tarawa in order
            to receive the latest information on situations and events that could affect your
            safety.

            Tourist facilities and services are limited.

            Exercise caution when swimming offshore, as dangerous currents exist, particularly
            beyond the reef area. Riptides are common. Several drownings occur each year. The lagoon
            in south Tarawa is heavily polluted and swimming is generally not advised.

            Nuclear weapons development program

            Tensions have increased in the region as a result of North Korea’s ongoing nuclear
            weapons development program. In April and December 2012, North Korea attempted to launch
            two missiles into orbit, and on February 12, 2013, performed a nuclear weapons test.
            Additional tests cannot be ruled out.
            North Korea and South Korea

            Relations between North Korea and South Korea remain tense. On March 11, 2013, North
            Korea issued a statement declaring that the Korean Armistice Agreement is invalid. While
            past threats made by the North to nullify this agreement have gone unfulfilled, this
            statement has raised tension in the region.

            Border skirmishes with South Korean armed forces occur occasionally. The security
            situation could deteriorate suddenly. Due to very limited access to international media
            broadcasts in North Korea, you may be taken by surprise by events that could affect your
            security.
            Crime

            The crime rate is low. Petty crime occurs, especially at the airport in Pyongyang and in
            public markets. Ensure personal belongings, passports and other travel documents are
            secure at all times.
            Transportation

            Travel within North Korea is severely restricted. Transportation is usually provided by
            local tour representatives or authorities. Traffic is usually minimal, and major
            highways are in good condition. Rural roads can be hazardous. Police checkpoints,
            usually located at the entry to towns, may require that travellers provide documentation
            before onward travel is permitted.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            General safety information

            There is no resident Canadian government office in the country. Register with the
            Embassy of Canada in Seoul, South Korea, and with the Swedish Embassy in Pyongyang.

            Canadian or Swedish authorities may encounter major difficulties and delays in obtaining
            consular access to you if you are detained, particularly outside of the capital,
            Pyongyang. The provision of consular access is solely at the discretion of the North
            Korean government. Knowledge of North Korean police and judicial systems is limited,
            which may affect our ability to provide assistance to you.

            Tourist facilities are minimal and telecommunications are unreliable. Individual tourism
            can be arranged only through a handful of North Korean government-approved travel
            agencies. Travel must be authorized in advance by the government. Travellers are closely
            observed. Hotel rooms, telephones and fax machines are monitored. There are serious
            shortages of food, electricity and clean water.

            Tensions between South Korea and North Korea

            Tensions have increased on the Korean peninsula as a result of North Korea\'s ongoing
            nuclear weapons development program and provocative statements. In April and December
            2012, North Korea attempted to launch two missiles into orbit, and on February 12, 2013,
            performed a nuclear weapon test. Additional tests cannot be ruled out.

            On March 11, 2013, North Korea issued a statement declaring that the Korean Armistice
            Agreement is invalid. While past threats made by the North to nullify this agreement
            have gone unfulfilled, further provocative action could occur.

            Despite recent statements issued by the North Korean government, we continue to advise
            that there is no immediate threat to Canadians in South Korea. However, as tensions
            could escalate with little warning, be vigilant, monitor developments and follow the
            advice of local authorities.
            Crime

            Crime against foreigners is generally low. Remain aware of your surroundings and avoid
            walking alone after dark. The use of public transport after dark may be safer than using
            taxis when travelling alone. However, when subway and bus services end for the night,
            use officially marked taxis only and, if possible, do not travel alone. Ensure that your
            personal belongings, passports and other travel documents are secure at all times.

            The Korean National Police operates a 24-hour, seven-day-a-week Central Interpretation
            Centre where foreigners can report crimes (in Seoul, telephone 313-0842; elsewhere,
            02-313-0842).
            Women’s safety

            Sexual assaults against foreigners have occurred. Consult our publication entitled Her
            Own Way: A Woman’s Safe-Travel Guide for travel safety information specifically aimed at
            Canadian women.
            Demonstrations

            Political, labour and student demonstrations and marches can become confrontational or
            violent. Exercise caution, avoid areas where demonstrations are being held and avoid
            confrontations with protestors.
            Transportation

            The rate of fatal road accidents is very high. Automobile drivers are presumed to be at
            fault in accidents involving motorcycles or pedestrians. Criminal charges and heavy
            penalties are common when accidents result in injury.

            Taxi drivers may speak some English. Have your destination written in Korean.

            A high-speed train (KTX) links Seoul and major southern cities such as Busan, Kwangju
            and Mokpo.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            Emergency services

            Dial 112 to reach police and 119 for ambulance and firefighters. An English
            interpretation service is available from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. every day.

            orthern Kosovo (see Advisory)

            The level of tension remains elevated in the municipalities of Zvecan, Zubin Potok and
            Leposavic and the northern part of the city of Mitrovica. Protests, as well as political
            and inter-ethnic violence, may occur at any time.

            There is limited freedom of movement at the border crossings of Brnjak and Jarinje (also
            known as Gate 1 and Gate 31). Avoid travelling in these areas until the security
            situation improves. If required to travel in these areas, be vigilant, avoid crowds and
            demonstrations, and follow the advice of local authorities.
            Political tension

            Kosovo declared independence on February 17, 2008, and Canada recognized Kosovo on March
            18, 2008. However, the Serbian government has not recognized Kosovo and continues to
            challenge the legality of its unilateral declaration of independence. Direct bilateral
            talks between Serbia and Kosovo began in March 2011 in Brussels, Belgium, under European
            Union mediation.

            The United Nations (UN) agreed to the reconfiguration of the UN Mission in Kosovo
            (UNMIK), and the European Rule of Law Mission (EULEX) started its mandate on December 9,
            2008. The Kosovo Force (KFOR) led by NATO remains in Kosovo and continues to contribute
            toward maintaining a safe and secure environment.
            Crime

            Petty crime such as pickpocketing and purse snatching is prevalent. Foreigners could be
            targeted by thieves, especially in crowded public areas such as markets and public
            transportation facilities, particularly in Pristina. Carjacking and car theft also
            occur.

            Should you see an unattended bag, suspicious device or anything out of the ordinary, you
            are advised to immediately report to the appropriate local authorities. The UN has
            advised its staff to check under and around their vehicles before they are driven.
            Demonstrations

            Demonstrations occur and have the potential to suddenly turn violent. Avoid all
            demonstrations and large gatherings, follow the advice of local authorities and monitor
            local media.
            Landmines and unexploded ordnance

            International explosive ordnance disposal teams have cleared all major routes and
            population centres. They have marked remaining sites known to contain mines or other
            unexploded ordnance (UXO). However, unexploded landmines may remain along the
            Albania-Kosovo border. UXO, particularly cluster bombs, is a problem throughout rural
            areas, and can also be found in urban areas. Off-road travel and hiking in wooded areas
            can be dangerous. Exercise vigilance and avoid taking risks.
            Road travel

            Secondary roads are often narrow and poorly maintained.

            Travel to Mitrovica North may be restricted and requires approval from UNMIK.

            There have been incidents where police target vehicles with foreign plates, often
            demanding immediate cash payment for alleged traffic violations. If stopped, you should
            request a full explanation and, if an explanation is not forthcoming, request permission
            to speak to the Embassy of Canada to Croatia in Zagreb.
            Public transportation

            Public transportation is old and overcrowded. Periodic disruptions of bus service may
            occur. Rail services are generally poor. Use only officially marked taxis and negotiate
            fares in advance if a meter is not in use.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            General safety information

            Ensure that your personal belongings, passports and other travel documents are secure at
            all times. Avoid showing signs of affluence and carrying large sums of cash.
            Emergency services

            Dial 92 for police, 93 for fire fighters, 94 for an ambulance and 987 for roadside
            assistance.

            Terrorism

            On September 21, 2014, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) released a
            statement threatening retaliation for the American-led coalition campaign against ISIL
            in Iraq and Syria. The statement encouraged opportunistic and indiscriminate attacks
            against citizens and interests of countries supporting the coalition, including
            Canadians. Individuals and terrorist groups in the region may be inspired to carry out
            attacks in a show of solidarity with ISIL. Canadians could also be targeted by a
            terrorist attack and be considered kidnapping targets. Exercise a high degree of
            personal security awareness, maintain a heightened level of vigilance and be aware of
            your surroundings at all times.

            There is a terrorist threat throughout the Arabian Peninsula. From time to time, reports
            emerge that terrorists plan to attack specific locations in one of these countries.
            Targets could include government buildings, public areas, tourist sites and Western
            interests. Heightened security measures are currently in place and may be reinforced
            upon short notice. Exercise caution in commercial, public or tourist areas frequented by
            foreigners, monitor local developments and follow the advice of local authorities.
            Maintain a high level of vigilance and personal security awareness at all times.
            Crime

            The crime rate is low and violence is rare, including against foreigners. However, you
            should avoid secluded places or non-residential areas after dark.

            Report any suspicion of being followed or unexplained loitering to the local police.
            Locals have sometimes followed Westerners home after dark and then vandalized their
            parked vehicles.
            Demonstrations

            Demonstrations occur and have the potential to suddenly turn violent. They can lead to
            significant disruptions to traffic and public transportation. Avoid all demonstrations
            and large gatherings, follow the advice of local authorities and monitor local media.
            Women’s safety

            There have been reports of physical and verbal harassment toward women. Travelling
            alone, especially after dark, is not advisable. Consult our publication entitled Her Own
            Way: A Woman’s Safe-Travel Guide for travel safety information specifically aimed at
            Canadian women.
            Road travel

            Accidents are common and due mainly to unsafe driving practices such as reckless
            driving. Exercise caution when driving after dark.

            In the event of an accident, do not attempt to move the vehicle, even though it may
            impede traffic. Kuwaiti law states that the driver must wait for the police to make an
            official report. Be aware that digital cameras register traffic violations.

            Off-road driving can be hazardous. Undertake off-road driving in a convoy of
            four-wheel-drive vehicles with an experienced guide only. Leave a travel itinerary with
            a family member or friend. Be well prepared and equipped with gasoline, water, food and
            a cellular phone.

            Use only officially marked taxis and pre-negotiate fares.
            Air travel

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            Sea travel

            Consult the Ministry of Interior of the State of Kuwait for instructions and regulations
            for sailing in Kuwaiti waters.

            Pirate attacks occur in coastal waters and, in some cases, farther out at sea. Mariners
            should take appropriate precautions. For additional information, consult the Live Piracy
            Report published by the International Maritime Bureau.

            Exercise caution if travelling by sea, including for recreational purposes, in the
            Persian Gulf, particularly around the islands of Abu Masa and the Tunbs, as both Iran
            and the UAE have claimed sovereignty over the islands.
            General safety information

            Leave your passport in a safe place and carry a photocopy for identification purposes at
            all times.

            Unexploded munitions from the 1991 Gulf War pose hazards in rural areas, picnic spots
            and beaches. Monitor children closely. Do not touch suspicious unfamiliar objects.

            Weapons are readily available, and accidental shootings have occurred.
            Emergency services

            Areas south and west of Osh, the Fergana Valley and borders with Uzbekistan and
            Tajikistan

            Violent clashes were reported in the Batken, Jalal-Abad and Osh oblasts (provinces) in
            June 2010 that left more than 350 people dead and at least 2,000 injured. Although no
            incidents have occurred recently, the security situation in areas south and west of Osh,
            throughout the Fergana Valley and along the borders with Uzbekistan and Tajikistan
            remains volatile and unpredictable, and there is a possibility of violence and unrest.

            Areas bordering Uzbekistan and Tajikistan are mined. Only use officially recognized
            border crossings, as landmines may be present in uncontrolled border areas. Confirm that
            border posts are open before travelling there.
            Terrorism

            Heightened regional tensions may place you at greater risk. Maintain a high level of
            personal security awareness at all times, particularly in commercial establishments
            (such as hotels, clubs, restaurants, bars, schools, places of worship), public places,
            at outdoor recreational events and in tourist areas frequented by foreigners.
            Other border crossings

            Uzbekistan land border crossings are open to citizens of some countries, including
            Canada, but are closed to Kyrgyz citizens. Access to border crossings with Kazakhstan
            may be restricted without warning.
            Crime

            The Kyrgyz Republic has a high rate of violent crime and foreigners have been targeted.
            Organized gangs are common. Robbery, mugging and pickpocketing occur frequently near
            major hotels, bars and parks and on public transportation. Remain vigilant and ensure
            that your personal belongings and documents are secure. Do not show signs of affluence
            and avoid carrying large sums of money.

            Robberies have been committed by men in police uniforms; if approached by such a man,
            ask to see his police credentials. Also, men posing as “meet and greet” airport
            facilitators lure unsuspecting foreigners into cars and demand money. Make prior
            arrangements with your contacts and ask for identification upon arrival. Do not leave
            the airport with anyone who does not show you their identification.
            Demonstrations

            Demonstrations occur and have the potential to suddenly turn violent. They can lead to
            significant disruptions to traffic and public transportation. Avoid all demonstrations
            and large gatherings, follow the advice of local authorities and monitor local media.
            Public transportation

            Avoid public transportation, which is unsafe and unreliable.

            At night, call a reputable taxi service in advance before leaving popular restaurants
            and places of recreation. Foreigners have been specifically targeted leaving such
            venues.

            Use only officially marked taxis, pre-negotiate the fare and do not share a ride with
            strangers.
            Road travel

            Drive defensively, as traffic accidents are a common cause of death and injury. Roads
            are poorly maintained and inadequately lit, and traffic regulations are often ignored.
            Buy gas in the cities of Bishkek and Osh because there are few gas stations outside
            those cities.

            Roads to Tashkent are hazardous in winter.
            Air travel

            Air travel is limited. Unannounced delays and flight cancellations are common in winter
            due to poor weather conditions. Reservations on regional airlines are not always
            respected. Confirm flights with your airline prior to departure.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            General safety information

            Police can arrest visitors who do not carry identification. Keep a legally certified
            copy of your visa and registration with you at all times, and your passport and visa in
            safekeeping facilities. Leave a photocopy of your travel documents with a relative or a
            friend at home.

            Do not walk or travel alone, especially at night.

            Tourist facilities are not highly developed.
            Emergency services

            Dial 101 for fire emergency services and 102 for police.

            Crime

            Street crime is prevalent in cities and towns including Vientiane, Luang Prabang and
            Vang Vieng, and occasionally involves violence. Bag theft occurs frequently. Thieves on
            motorcycles grab bags and other valuables from pedestrians, other motorcycle drivers and
            their passengers. Ensure that your personal belongings, passports and other travel
            documents are secure at all times. Do not show signs of affluence and avoid travelling
            late at night. Break-ins at hotels and guesthouses occur. Armed robberies occur
            occasionally in Phou Khao Khouay National Park.

            Sexual assaults occur, particularly in Vientiane, Luang Prabang, and Vang Vieng. Be
            particularly vigilant along hiking trails. Consult our publication entitled Her own way
            - a woman’s safe-travel guide for travel safety information specifically aimed at
            Canadian women.

            Local police may not have the capacity to respond to crimes, especially at night.
            Demonstrations

            Avoid large gatherings and demonstrations, and follow the advice of local authorities.
            Spiked food and drinks

            Never leave your food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers. Be wary of
            accepting snacks, beverages, gum or cigarettes from new acquaintances, as they may
            contain drugs that could put you at risk of sexual assault and robbery.

            Some food and drinks, such as “happy pizzas” and “special shakes,” may contain
            unspecified amounts of opium and other unknown substances. These items are sold in areas
            frequented by tourists, particularly in Vang Vieng. While these items may be easily
            accessible, taking any amount of opiates can be dangerous. Foreigners, including
            Canadians, have died as a result of drug overdoses.
            Landmines

            Landmines and unexploded ordnance constitute a risk across the country, particularly in
            the Plain of Jars, in the province of Xieng Khouang , as well as in the
            Laotian-Vietnamese border areas, including those formerly traversed by the Ho Chi Minh
            Trail. Follow the advice of local authorities, and only travel on well-used roads and
            paths.
            Transportation

            Road travel in Laos can be hazardous, as vehicles are often poorly maintained and road
            conditions are poor, especially during the rainy season. Drivers have little regard for
            traffic regulations and do not follow safe driving practices. Livestock often stray onto
            the roads, causing accidents. Travel should be undertaken only during daylight hours.
            Travellers involved in traffic accidents have been required to pay compensation for
            property damage or injury, regardless of who the police judge to be at fault. Laotian
            insurers will generally only meet a small proportion of the costs of an accident and
            refuse to cover compensation, which can be the largest expense.

            Do not leave your passport as collateral when renting vehicles, including motorcycles.
            Read rental contracts thoroughly to ensure that the vehicle is correctly insured to
            cover damages and theft. Only rent from reputable companies, as some companies have been
            known to “steal” the vehicle, particularly motorcycles, and claim for the loss. If your
            passport is inaccessible or stolen as a result of misuse, you may be subject to
            investigation by Passport Canada and may receive limited passport services.

            Public transportation is unreliable and limited after dark. River travel is common in
            Laos; however, travel by boat on the Mekong River from Vientiane to Luang Prabang is
            unreliable. Safety standards are minimal. Speedboat travel is especially dangerous
            during the dry season (November to May). Lifejackets and helmets should be provided to
            and worn by passengers. Do not travel on or across the Mekong River after dark. In some
            areas, the Laotian military has been known to shoot at boats after dark.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            River-based sporting activities

            Exercise extreme caution and carefully consider your safety when engaging in river-based
            sporting activities, including in Vang Vieng. Travellers have died or been seriously
            injured while taking part in river-based activities such as tubing or jumping/diving
            into the river. River levels can fluctuate considerably and debris can make river-based
            activities dangerous.
            General safety information

            Canadians are encouraged to register with the Embassy of Australia in Vientiane in order
            to receive the latest information on situations and events that could affect their
            safety.

            Tourist facilities outside Vientiane and Luang Prabang are limited. International
            telephone and email facilities are available in Vientiane but are extremely limited
            elsewhere. Even where available, these services are often unreliable and expensive.

            Comply with requests to stop at checkpoints and roadblocks. Travellers are subject to
            search, detention and the possibility of fines by authorities if suitable identification
            is not presented. Security authorities may place foreigners under surveillance. Hotel
            rooms, telephones, fax machines and email messages may be monitored. Personal
            possessions in hotel rooms may be searched.
            Emergency services

            Dial 191 to reach police, 195 for ambulance or 190 for fire fighters.

            The Vientiane Tourist Police can be reached at +856 021 251 128.

            Crime

            Petty crime (pickpocketing, purse snatching and mugging) occurs in Riga, especially in
            the old part of town, in the market area and around the main railway station. Avoid
            walking alone after dark, especially in parks and poorly lit areas.

            Car theft is common in Riga. Lock unattended vehicles and conceal all items, including
            radios. Keep vehicles in a guarded parking lot, particularly overnight.
            Scams and fraud

            Credit card fraud is a concern. When using your card, ensure that it remains in view and
            retain your transaction copy along with the carbon paper, should there be one.

            See Overseas Fraud for more information on scams abroad.
            Road travel

            Poor and aggressive driving practices and traffic congestion create problems. In the
            event of an accident, do not move the vehicles until authorized to do so by the police.

            The highway system is generally good, but poor lighting poses risks to pedestrians,
            cyclists and motorists. Secondary roads may not be paved.

            Winter driving can be especially dangerous since roads are not always cleared of snow.
            Beware of fog, snow and ice while driving. Expect border delays when arriving by road
            from Russia and Belarus.
            Public transportation

            Bus service is generally comfortable and reliable. Trains operate throughout the
            country.

            Taxis are a reliable means of transportation. Use only officially marked taxis, such as
            Red Cab, Baltic Taxi and Lady Taxi.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            Spiked food and drinks

            Never leave food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers. Be wary of accepting
            snacks, beverages, gum or cigarettes from new acquaintances, as they may contain drugs
            that could put you at risk of sexual assault and robbery.
            Demonstrations

            Demonstrations occur occasionally and have the potential to suddenly turn violent. Avoid
            all demonstrations and large gatherings, follow the advice of local authorities and
            monitor local media.
            General safety measures

            Exercise normal safety precautions. Avoid showing signs of affluence and carrying large
            sums of cash. Ensure that your personal belongings, passports and other travel documents
            are secure at all times.
            Emergency services

            Dial 112 to reach police, firefighters, ambulance and gas emergency services.

            The Riga Municipality Police has a tourism division for foreigners in distress; dial
            +371 6718 1818 for assistance, available in English, 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

            Dial 1188 to reach the tourist inquiry hotline for tourism information, assistance and
            advice or to express a grievance; assistance is available in English, to get tourism
            information, assistance and advice or to express a grievance.

            Southern suburbs of Beirut (see Advisory)

            Large parts of Beirut’s southern suburbs are controlled by armed groups, such as
            Hezbollah, in addition to the Lebanese government’s security forces. Since mid-2013,
            these neighbourhoods have been frequently targeted by terrorist attacks that cause
            deaths and injuries. Tactics used by terrorists include car bombing, suicide bombing and
            rocket fire.

            Road blocks and demonstrations are also likely, and the latter may turn violent without
            notice. Avoid all affected areas, monitor local news reports and follow the advice of
            local authorities.

            Although Bir Hassan is excluded from our advisory, Iranian interests in the
            neighbourhood have been subject to sporadic attacks since November 2013. When in Bir
            Hassan, be aware of your surroundings at all times.
            North Lebanon (see Advisory)

            The security situation in northern Lebanon is unstable. Tripoli has been particularly
            polarized by the conflict in Syria, and the neighbourhoods of Bab al Tabbaneh and Jabal
            Mohsen regularly experience inter-communal violence, which may spread to outlying areas.
            Heavy weapons fire (machine guns, grenades and rocket-propelled grenades) and sniper
            activity are common, inevitably causing deaths and injuries. Lebanese security forces
            are conducting operations in northern Lebanon to restore order. They are authorized to
            use lethal force, and have clashed with militants in the area. Avoid affected areas,
            monitor local news reports and follow the advice of local authorities.
            Border region with Syria and the northern Bekaa Valley (see Advisory)

            The security situation in regions bordering Syria has deteriorated as a result of the
            ongoing conflict in that country. Armed groups such as the al-Nusra Front and the
            Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), and the Lebanese and Syrian military, often
            carry out operations in the Arsal region, including shelling and incursions, and these
            have resulted in deaths and injuries. Similar attacks may occur in other areas near the
            eastern border of Lebanon with Syria. Tensions between armed groups have also increased
            in border areas, resulting in kidnappings and frequent violent clashes.

            Exercise extreme caution and remain aware of your whereabouts, as the border is not
            always clearly demarcated.
            Abra (see Advisory)

            There have been violent clashes between the LAF and local militias in the Abra area,
            near Saïda. Heavy weapons fire (machine guns, grenades and rocket-propelled grenades)
            and sniper activity in Abra have caused numerous deaths and injuries, and violence
            occasionally spills over into parts of Saïda. Exercise caution, avoid affected areas,
            follow the advice of local authorities and monitor local news reports.
            Areas south of the Litani River (see Advisory)

            The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) maintains additional peacekeepers
            south of the Litani River near the border with Israel as a result of the border
            conflict. This region remains highly militarized and volatile. Rocket launches and
            border incidents occasionally occur, provoking retaliatory attacks in this region and
            elsewhere in Lebanon, and causing injury and death.

            Forces other than the Lebanese authorities exert significant control over parts of this
            region. Access restrictions may delay or prevent Canadian officials from providing
            assistance to citizens in these areas.

            Lebanon and Israel have not agreed on an international border. The UN enforces the “Blue
            Line,” which separates the two countries but has not been fully demarcated. Areas
            adjacent to the Blue Line are often heavily mined. The areas of Ghajar, Kfar Shouba
            Hills and Shebaa Farms are still inaccessible from Lebanon. The border with Israel is
            closed.

            If you are travelling to the city of Tyre, use only the main coastal highway.
            Palestinian refugee camps (see Advisory)

            The security situation in Palestinian refugee camps remains tense and unpredictable.
            Violence is common in some camps -particularly Ein el Helwe near Saïda, and Beddawi near
            Tripoli- and often triggered as a result of regional events.

            As the refugee camps are often located close to urban centres and are not always visibly
            demarcated, exercise caution and remain aware of your whereabouts at all times in order
            to avoid unknowingly entering a camp.
            Kidnapping

            Sectarian- and politically-motivated kidnappings are increasingly frequent in the border
            areas with Syria and the Bekaa Valley. In the southern suburbs of Beirut, foreigners and
            residents have been held against their will. Maintain a high level of vigilance at all
            times. Although most incidents of kidnapping typically involve Lebanese residents,
            foreign residents have been held for ransom.
            Demonstrations

            Planned and spontaneous demonstrations related to the domestic and regional situation
            regularly occur in Lebanon. While there have been no reports of injuries, some
            demonstrations have led to roadblocks, the burning of tires and the firing of weapons.
            In some instances, the LAF have erected checkpoints to manage protests.

            The road to the airport is subject to sporadic closure, due to various factors including
            local sectarian clashes, civil unrest in Syria and protests against government policies.
            Access to the airport may be unavailable for extended periods if the security situation
            deteriorates.

            Monitor current developments closely when travelling within Lebanon, as local conditions
            may change rapidly and without warning, compromising your mobility and safety. Avoid all
            demonstrations and large gatherings, follow the advice of local authorities and monitor
            local media. You should also observe all warnings issued by Lebanese authorities and
            take appropriate precautions.
            Special Tribunal for Lebanon

            The Special Tribunal for Lebanon (STL), the international body investigating the
            assassination of Rafik Hariri, former prime minister, has indicted suspects and begun
            trying them. Releases of information related to the trial has led to unrest. Monitor
            media reports pertaining to the STL and keep informed of any political and security
            development.
            Landmines

            Landmines and unexploded ordnance continue to pose a significant threat, particularly in
            the south, despite progress in demining activities. Be aware of posted landmine
            warnings, stay on paved roads and avoid walking or driving cross-country. Recently,
            various reports have indicated that Syrian troops planted landmines along its border
            with northern Lebanon.
            Crime

            The crime rate is increasing; petty crime, car thefts and residential break-ins occur
            more frequently. Exercise additional safety precautions.

            Foreigners using shared transportation have been victims of armed robberies, either by
            the driver or other passengers.
            Transportation

            Congestion and aggressive driving are serious problems throughout the country, and
            drivers have little regard for traffic laws. Road accidents causing injury or death are
            common in Lebanon. At night, road lighting is sporadic and unreliable in urban areas and
            virtually non-existent in rural areas. Many drivers use their high beams exclusively,
            often creating a serious hazard due to blinding glare. Mountain roads may be subject to
            fog, heavy snow, ice and other hazardous conditions during winter months.

            Lebanese drivers are unaccustomed to sharing the road with bicycles. Exercise great
            caution when cycling.

            Pedestrians should be extremely careful at all times.

            Do not use shared or “service” taxis. On February 3, 2014, there was an explosion on a
            minibus in the Choueifat area of Beirut. Pre-arrange transportation with a reputable
            company: don’t hail taxis in the street.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            General safety information

            Ensure that your personal belongings and passports and other travel documents are
            secure. Keep photocopies of all your documents in safekeeping facilities.

            There is a highly visible security presence throughout the country. Carry personal
            documentation with you and obey the instructions of Lebanese security authorities.

            Crime

            Petty crime, such as pickpocketing, purse snatching and mugging, is prevalent and
            increases at night and on weekends. Violent crime has increased, particularly in the
            capital, Maseru, between local hotels and the business district. Foreigners are often
            targeted.

            Armed robbery, carjacking and residential break-ins occur, especially in Maseru and
            other large towns, including Maputsoe and Leribe. Foreigners, especially tourists,
            members of foreign missions and other expatriate professionals have experienced such
            incidents.

            Avoid walking alone, even during daylight hours. Walking or driving after dark is
            extremely risky.Do not resist assailants if attacked or robbed and avoid eye contact if
            possible.
            Elections and demonstrations

            Demonstrations and general strikes occur and have the potential to suddenly turn
            violent. They can lead to significant disruptions to traffic and public transportation.

            The results of the February 28 legislative elections should be announced in early March.
            Demonstrations may take place as results are finalized and a new government is formed.
            Avoid all demonstrations and large gatherings, follow the advice of local authorities
            and monitor local media.
            Road travel

            Traffic drives on the left. Local driving habits pose a risk in Maseru. Livestock,
            pedestrians, vehicles moving without lights and other hazards are frequently encountered
            on the roads. Ensure windows are closed and doors locked at all times. Offering rides to
            hitchhikers is dangerous. Remain vigilant when stopping at scenic points or rest
            stations. There are few gas stations outside of cities and large towns. There are no
            road side assistance services operating in Lesotho. You should park in well-lit areas.

            All Lesotho-South Africa border crossings and eight of Lesotho’s 10 district capitals
            are linked by good roads. It can take a very long time to get through border crossings.
            Rural communities are linked by secondary gravel roads that are in bad condition, poorly
            lit and best suited to four-wheel drive vehicles. Many rural areas, particularly in the
            mountainous two thirds of the country, can be reached only by basic dirt roads or on
            horseback.
            Public transportation

            Avoid using minibus taxis; they are poorly maintained and often involved in accidents.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            General safety information

            You should carry identification documents at all times.

            Remain vigilant at all times and ensure that personal belongings and travel documents
            are secure.

            Tourist facilities are developing in Lesotho but remain very limited. Check the level of
            security provided at the hotel or accommodation you are contemplating before making
            reservations.

            Car rentals are available in Maseru. Cars rented in South Africa may be brought into
            Lesotho with a letter of authorization from the rental company. Some rental companies do
            not issue letters of authorization.

            For emergency assistance, dial 112 or 588-81-010 and 115 for the fire department.

            Area bordering Côte d\'ivoire

            This border area has been highly unstable in the past, and the presence of armed
            militias and the lack of proper security force patrols increase the risk to travellers.
            Ebola

            Quarantine measures are strictly enforced. Screening measures are in place at entry
            points in an attempt to contain the Ebola outbreak. Some airlines have suspended flights
            to and from Liberia. Confirm the status of your flight with the airline before heading
            to the airport.
            Crime

            Liberia is one of the poorest countries in the world. A high degree of poverty increases
            the likeliness of criminality, and crime levels in Liberia are high, including in the
            capital. Muggings, armed assaults and theft are prevalent. Avoid walking alone and
            displaying any signs of affluence in public, and do not leave valuables or bags
            unattended. Residential armed break-ins are also common. Crime significantly increases
            at night due to the lack of electricity in some parts of the capital.

            Violent crimes, including aggravated sexual assault and murder, routinely occur and have
            involved foreigners. Police forces can rarely offer protection and do not have the
            capacity to investigate and prosecute.
            Demonstrations

            Large demonstrations, often politically motivated, have happened in the past and there
            could be more. The tension that accompanied the presidential and legislative elections
            in October and November 2011 has subsided and has given way to a more stable
            environment. However, violence could still occur during public demonstrations. Avoid all
            demonstrations and large gatherings, follow the advice of local authorities and monitor
            local media.
            Local authorities

            The UNMIL force provides national authorities with support and guarantees of limited
            security on major roads as well as around Monrovia and the main population centres.
            However, security problems persist throughout the country, including in Monrovia and
            many outlying regions.
            Fraud

            Cases of attempted fraud are frequently reported in this country. See our Overseas Fraud
            page for more information on scams abroad.
            Transportation

            Roberts International Airport (RIA) is located 56 kilometres outside Monrovia. Daytime
            air service is very limited. With the supervision of UNMIL, the airport is accessible,
            but expect frequently crowded and disorganized conditions. Since public transportation
            to Monrovia is not reliable, arrange to be met upon arrival at the airport and dropped
            off on departure by reliable contacts. If transportation is not arranged, you are
            advised to hire cars and drivers from reputable security providers with respect to
            journey management.

            During the day, travellers may circulate safely on the country’s roads, as well as in
            the capital, Monrovia, however, renting a car and driving yourself is not recommended.
            Overland travel can be hazardous and should only be undertaken in a four-wheel-drive
            vehicle. Roads are generally in poor condition and rarely paved outside Monrovia.
            Moreover, their condition deteriorates significantly during the rainy season.

            Travel after dark is particularly dangerous and is not recommended. There are no
            operating traffic lights and all roads are unlit; exercise caution when approaching
            intersections. Overloaded vehicles frequently stop without signalling, pedestrians
            routinely dodge traffic and roaming animals pose a hazard.

            Drivers may be required to pull off the road with headlights turned off when high-speed
            car convoys carrying government officials announce their presence. It is advisable to
            wait a few minutes after the convoy passes before resuming your journey.

            The number of UNMIL security checkpoints has significantly decreased and they are much
            less obstrusive than in the past. However, they can still cause significant delays.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            General safety information

            Secure tourist facilities and accommodations are very limited in Monrovia and there is
            little to no infrastructure outside the capital. Travel outside Monrovia and in rural
            areas is generally inadvisable. There is no landline telephone system in the country.
            Mobile telecommunications exist in Monrovia and other major towns, however many remote
            areas and stretches of road between major towns have no coverage. North American cell
            phones do not always work in Liberia.

            Water is not commercially available in Monrovia and there is no functioning sewage
            system. However, bottled water is available from many businesses.

            Fuel shortages are common and transportation services are severely limited or inadequate
            in rural areas.

            When visiting the beach, swimmers should be aware of dangerous currents.

            You should carry valid official photo identification with you at all times, preferably a
            certified copy of your passport’s identification page. Ensure that you always maintain
            sufficient supplies of food, water and other essentials.

            Terrorism

            There is a high risk of terrorism in all of Libya, and attacks can occur at any time
            throughout the country. Extremist groups have specifically threatened Westerners and
            Western interests in Libya, and have carried out attacks against these targets. Targets
            of attacks have included foreign officials, diplomats, aid workers, tourists, teachers,
            other private-sector workers and embassies. Commercial and public areas known to be
            frequented by foreigners, such as hotels, schools, hospitals, office buildings, air and
            sea ports, public events, public transportation, markets and shopping areas, have also
            been targeted.

            Ansar al-Sharia, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), al-Qaeda and other
            extremist groups active in Libya have specifically targeted foreigners in past attacks.

            The situation in Benghazi is particularly unstable and volatile. Attacks against foreign
            interests and foreigners occur regularly.

            Be extremely vigilant and aware of your surroundings at all times.
            Civil unrest and violent conflict

            The political situation is extremely fragile. The capital has been seized by a coalition
            of armed groups, and the democratically elected government has been driven into exile in
            Tobruk, in the east of the country. Formal state security structures have largely
            collapsed.

            Armed clashes are ongoing throughout the country, and violence spread from eastern Libya
            to the capital in June 2014. Fighting between armed groups supporting the elected
            government in Tobruk and the opposition government in Tripoli occurs daily. Hundreds of
            people have been killed, thousands injured and hundreds of thousands displaced by the
            fighting.

            Demonstrations and protests are a regular occurrence across Libya and have resulted in
            violence and fatalities. Follow the security situation closely through local media
            reports, take appropriate steps to increase your personal security and limit your
            movements to daylight hours. Avoid public gatherings and all demonstrations, as they may
            become violent without warning.
            Kidnapping

            There is a high threat of kidnapping in Libya. Foreigners are common targets. Maintain a
            high level of vigilance at all times.
            Border areas

            You may face heightened risks at the border areas with Niger, Chad, Sudan, Tunisia and
            Algeria due to the presence of armed groups, the threat of banditry and an extreme
            kidnapping risk. Borders may close on short notice, including in particular the borders
            with Egypt and Tunisia.

            Travel to the interior and to border areas without an officially sanctioned guide or
            specific permission from the Libyan authorities is forbidden, with the exception of the
            official land border crossings to Egypt and Tunisia.
            Crime

            The crime rate is very high in Libya, where weapons are easily available and government
            forces do not have control of the country. Carjackings and armed robberies are common
            occurrences.
            Landmines

            The risk of encountering unexploded ordnance and indiscriminately laid landmines is high
            in all areas where has fighting occurred. Exercise caution in these areas.
            Transportation

            The Tripoli International Airport has been closed since it was destroyed in
            inter-factional in July 2014. Benghazi airport has been closed since early 2014, having
            likewise sustained damage due to heavy fighting in the vicinity. Currently, only Mitiga
            (in Tripoli), Misrata, Labraq (in Baida) and Tobruk airports offer international
            flights. Flights are frequently cancelled; tickets must be obtained in advance, and paid
            for in cash on site.

            Airports have been frequently targeted for rocket, artillery and terrorist attack. Check
            the status of your flight prior to travelling to the airport and avoid travelling after
            dark.

            The road system is extensive, but many roads in the south are unpaved and there are only
            sand tracks in the desert. Avoid all road travel in the southeast, due to the
            possibility of landmines, kidnapping, banditry and terrorism. Traffic is heavy on the
            main east-west coastal highway, between Tripoli and the Tunisian border. Travel on the
            coastal highway in the east of the country is dangerous, due to ongoing inter-factional
            fighting and the risk of kidnapping by extremist groups.

            The rate of vehicle accidents is high. Poor driving skills, excessive speeds and traffic
            violations pose risks. Rental cars are available but expensive.

            In the event of an accident, remain calm and contact the local police. Local authorities
            may detain motorists involved in an accident until the court case is settled, if the
            accident resulted in loss of life or heavy damage.

            There have been recent incidents of vehicle ambush and carjacking resulting in injuries.

            Be cautious when using taxis. Negotiate fares prior to departure. Taxi drivers have been
            complicit in robberies targeting their passengers.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            General Security Information

            Since the beginning of the Libyan revolution in February 2011, falling rounds from
            celebratory gunfire have caused fatalities and injuries. Despite a reduction in these
            types of incidents, you should remain indoors in the event of any celebratory gunfire.

            Crime

            The crime rate is low. Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, occurs,
            especially during special events and in busy tourist areas. Exercise caution on trains,
            especially on overnight trips to neighbouring countries.
            Mountain activities

            If you intend to do mountaineering or ski touring:

            a) never practice these activities alone;

            b) always hire an experienced guide from a reputable company;

            c) buy travel health insurance that includes helicopter rescue and medical evacuation;

            d) ensure you are in top physical condition;

            e) advise a family member or friend of your itinerary;

            f) know the symptoms of acute altitude sickness, which can be fatal;

            g) register with the Embassy of Canada in Switzerland; and

            h) obtain detailed information on trekking routes or ski slopes before setting out.

            Special avalanche beacons can be purchased or rented to help searchers locate buried
            victims.
            Road travel

            Winter driving can be hazardous. Roads are mountainous, winding, and not always plowed.
            Snow chains are recommended. In the event of an accident, motorists should make an
            official report to police.
            Public transportation

            Public transportation is excellent.

            The postbus is an inexpensive and reliable way to travel within the country. Buses to
            Vaduz are available from the Swiss border towns of Buchs and Sargans, and from the
            Austrian border town of Feldkirch.

            The train from Zurich to Vienna stops in Feldkirch.

            There is no international airport. The closest one is approximately 130 kilometres away,
            in Zurich, Switzerland.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            General safety information

            Exercise normal safety precautions. Ensure that your personal belongings, passports and
            other travel documents are secure at all times.
            Emergency services

            Dial 117 to reach police, 144 for ambulance, 118 for firefighters and 140 for roadside
            assistance.

            Crime

            The crime rate is low. However, petty crime (mugging, purse snatching) occurs,
            particularly on public transport and in bars and restaurants.

            Foreigners are often targeted in less populated areas after dark. Walk only along main
            roads and sidewalks. At night, avoid walking alone in parks, poorly lit areas, parking
            lots and side streets and alleys, particularly in the Old Town and Užupis neighbourhoods
            of Vilnius.

            Auto theft occurs, especially of new and expensive cars. Lock unattended vehicles and
            conceal all items (including radios, GPS). Keep vehicles in a guarded parking lot,
            particularly overnight.
            Road travel

            Roads are generally in good condition, but lanes are not always clearly marked.
            Travelling at night in rural areas can be hazardous due to slow-moving horse-drawn
            carts, bicycles and vehicles travelling without taillights or reflectors on poorly lit
            streets and highways.

            Winter driving can be dangerous.
            Public transportation

            Taxis are inexpensive. Use only officially marked taxis from taxi stands or reputable
            hotels.

            Rail service is generally slow. While some trains have been updated, others are old and
            uncomfortable. Safeguard your personal belongings when travelling on overnight
            international trains.

            Bus service within the capital and its environs is safe and reliable. Frequent bus and
            air services link Lithuania to neighbouring countries.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            Demonstrations

            Demonstrations occur periodically in larger urban centres. Although they are usually
            peaceful, avoid all demonstrations and large gatherings as some may suddenly turn
            violent. Follow the advice of local authorities and monitor local media.
            Spiked food and drinks

            Never leave food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers. Be wary of accepting
            snacks, beverages, gum or cigarettes from new acquaintances, as they may contain drugs
            that could put you at risk of sexual assault and robbery. This may be of a particular
            concern at bus and railway stations.
            Fraud

            Credit card fraud occurs, particularly in areas frequented by tourists. When using your
            card, ensure that it remains in view and retain your transaction copy along with the
            carbon paper, should there be one.

            See Overseas Fraud for more information on scams abroad.
            General safety measures

            Exercise normal security precautions in crowded areas, on public transportation and at
            airports, railway stations, bars, restaurants and hotels. Ensure that your personal
            belongings, passports and other travel documents are secure at all times.

            The crime rate is low in Luxembourg. Petty crime (pickpocketing and purse snatching)
            occurs around train stations, the airport, and youth hostels in Luxembourg City. Do not
            leave personal belongings unattended, especially in vehicles.
            Road safety

            Traffic congestion in urban areas can be a problem.

            Carjacking incidents occur throughout the country. Ensure that valuables in vehicles are
            kept out of sight. Drive with the windows closed and car doors locked.

            If your vehicle has been hit and you feel your personal safety is at risk, do not leave
            your vehicle. Call the police or drive immediately to the nearest police station.

            Crime

            Petty crime (pickpocketing, purse snatching) occurs, especially in Skopje’s main
            downtown pedestrian zone, the Ramstore Mall, the Trgovski Centar shopping mall and
            Alexander the Great, Airport. Foreigners have been the target of muggings. Remain
            vigilant at all times.

            Occasional acts of inter-ethnic violence can occur.

            You should exercise a high degree of caution when travelling to the western border zone
            due to heightened criminal activity in the area.
            Demonstrations

            Demonstrations and political protests occur in Skopje and other towns, and striking
            workers may set up roadblocks. There has been a call for demonstrations in July 2014 in
            Skopje and several towns in North-West Macedonia (Tetovo, Gostivar, Struga, Kicevo,
            Kumanovo). Avoid all demonstrations, protests and large gatherings, as they have the
            potential to suddenly turn violent. Be vigilant, exercise caution in case of large
            gatherings, monitor local media and follow the advice of local authorities.
            Road travel

            Exercise caution when travelling by road, especially after dark. Secondary roads are
            poorly maintained and lack adequate lighting. In mountainous areas, most roads lack
            guard rails and are little more than dirt tracks above deep gorges. Ice and snow make
            driving hazardous in winter. Farm equipment and stray animals pose additional risks.

            Travellers may face delays at border crossings. Apart from designated crossing points,
            border areas are considered military restricted zones where travel is forbidden without
            official permission.

            Nosy Be

            Violent demonstrations took place in Hell-Ville and Ambatoloaka (Nosy be) in early
            October 2013. Two foreigners were killed. Exercise increased caution.
            Anosy region

            Since June 2012, a number of violent incidents involving cattle rustlers and killing
            several people have occurred in the Anosy Region of southeast Madagascar. Exercise
            extreme caution and maintain a high level of personal security awareness when travelling
            within Anosy, where tensions remain.
            Political situation

            Madagascar’s political situation has been unstable since the 2009 coup. Presidential
            elections were held in late 2013, but tensions could remain for a while.
            Demonstrations

            Demonstrations are taking place in Toamasina, in Tamatave, due to power cuts. Violent
            incidents causing injuries have occurred.

            Avoid all demonstrations, even those expected to be peaceful, as they could turn violent
            without notice. The situation remains volatile. Avoid the vicinity of historical
            monuments in Antananarivo, where violent incidents have occurred. Be watchful of
            suspicious, unaccompanied packages or bags left in public places, as there have been
            intermittent bombings in and around Antananarivo. Should unrest occur, airports may be
            closed with little notice and other departure options may be limited. Ensure that you
            have adequate supplies of water, food, fuel, money and medications, and that your
            documentation remains up-to-date. Monitor the situation on a regular basis and follow
            the instructions of local authorities.
            Crime

            Robberies and break-ins, often violent, have increased, especially in and around the
            capital, Antananarivo, but also in rural and isolated areas. Muggings, purse snatchings
            and pickpocketing also occur. Be particularly vigilant in areas frequented by tourists,
            including the steps leading to Rova, the Avenue de l’Indépendance, the Analakely market,
            the road leading to the Soarano train station, the Café de la gare and Tsaralalana.
            Ensure that your personal belongings and travel documents are secure, especially in
            airports and crowded places.

            There have been a number of instances of large-scale looting of shops and stores in
            recent years. The potential for further similar incidents remains.

            Gangs are known to commit home invasions and kidnappings, and to patrol areas where
            foreigners tend to congregate. Employees of non-governmental organizations may also be
            targeted.
            Be wary of persons representing themselves as “guides,” particularly on beaches and in
            coastal tourist areas, as there have been reports of attacks and robberies. Avoid
            visiting these areas alone.

            Thefts from vehicles occur frequently. Thieves target cars stuck in traffic for
            smash-and-grab robberies. When driving, you should keep the windows up, doors locked and
            valuables out of sight. Attacks on taxis and public transport are frequent, especially
            at night.

            Armed attacks occur on main highways, especially at night and particularly in the
            southern region of the country between Fianarantsoa and Tulear.
            Piracy

            Pirate attacks and armed robbery against ships occur in coastal waters. Mariners should
            take appropriate precautions. For additional information, consult the Live Piracy Report
            published by the International Maritime Bureau.
            Road travel

            Traffic drives on the right, yielding the right of way to vehicles coming from the left.
            The use of seat belts is mandatory. You are advised against driving in Madagascar; the
            vast majority of rental agencies only rent cars with drivers. Roads are in poor
            condition, except for a few main streets in the capital and some well-maintained roads
            to towns on the outskirts of the capital and to a few large towns elsewhere, including
            Tamatave, Mahajanga, Fianarantsoa and Toliara. Use a four-wheel drive vehicle if you
            must drive.

            Rural roads are poorly marked. Road conditions may get worse during the rainy season,
            especially in the northern provinces. Bridges are frequently washed away. Before setting
            out, confirm with local authorities that your chosen route is passable. Pedestrians and
            roaming animals, as well as slow-moving and poorly maintained vehicles, pose hazards.

            Local authorities occasionally set up roadblocks throughout the country. Follow their
            instructions and carry personal photographic identification at all times, preferably a
            certified true copy of your passport’s identification page.

            An International Driving Permit is recommended.
            Public transportation

            Public transportation (including bush taxis) is unreliable, as vehicles are poorly
            maintained. There is a semi-luxury minibus service between Antananarivo and Tamatave.
            Urban transport in regional towns generally closes down, as do most public activities,
            at about 8 p.m., leaving the rickshaw (pousse-pousse) as the sole means of travel.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            General safety information

            Avoid walking after dark and exercise caution when visiting beaches and isolated areas.
            Tourist facilities are available but vary in quality.

            Travel outside of Antananarivo at night is not recommended.

            Sharks are present, particularly in the Tamatave area.

            Dial 117 for emergency services.

            Crime

            Violent robberies and petty crime, such as pickpocketing, mugging and bag-snatching,
            occur. Tourists are particularly targeted on Kenyatta Drive, walking between the Old
            Town and the Capital City, at the main bus station in both Lilongwe and Blantyre as well
            as at the main ports for the Ilala ferry. Avoid walking alone at night. Con artists are
            active in major cities and tourist destinations such as Blantyre, Cape Maclear, Nkhata
            Bay, Senga Bay, Mzuzu and Zomba.

            Do not show signs of affluence. Muggings have resulted in the loss of travel and
            identification documents. Carry copies of your passport identification page and other
            travel documents and place the originals in safekeeping facilities.

            Residential break-ins and carjackings are prevalent throughout the country. Organized
            robberies and attacks by gangsters occur and may target foreigners. Carjackings often
            occur when a vehicle is stopped, for example, when waiting to enter at a compound
            vehicle gate, at intersections, or in traffic.

            In Malawi\'s capital, Lilongwe, as well as in Blantyre, Zomba and Mzuzu, there are
            reports of a gang of men attacking women wearing pants, leggings and short skirts. The
            women are stripped and robbed. Women travellers in these areas should avoid wearing
            close fitting clothing and be aware of their surroundings at all times.

            Contact the Mountain Club of Malawi for security advice before climbing Mount Mulanje.
            Demonstrations

            Political demonstrations and strike activity occur and can turn violent, especially in
            the capital Lilongwe. Exercise a high degree of caution, avoid demonstrations and large
            gatherings, monitor local media and follow the advice of local authorities.
            Road travel

            Traffic drives on the left. The traffic-related death rate is high. Poor road
            conditions, poorly maintained vehicles, and inadequate street lighting make driving
            dangerous. Potholes, pedestrians, animals, abandoned vehicles, and vehicles travelling
            at night without lights also pose risks. Avoid driving outside cities after dark.
            Emergency roadside assistance is very limited.

            Armed carjackings, particularly of four-wheel-drive vehicles, have occurred. You should
            not resist if threatened by carjackers. Always wear seat belts. Keep windows closed and
            doors locked and never leave your personal belongings in a vehicle.

            Hitchhiking or taking matola (informal lifts in the back of open vehicles) is considered
            dangerous.
            Public transportation

            Public transport is limited in rural areas. There are regular flights and bus services
            between Blantyre, Zomba, Lilongwe and Mzuzu. Travel by minibus between cities is not
            recommended, as they are overcrowded and poorly maintained.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            General safety information

            Exercise great caution, especially on buses, at bus stops, and while hiking, or when
            approached by persons who wish to befriend you, help you, or become your tour guide. Do
            not accept food or drink from strangers as it could be drugged. Do not leave your
            luggage unattended.

            Tourist facilities are limited outside of major centres.

            Hikers on Mount Mulanje are advised to employ a locally registered tour guide.
            Reserves and safaris

            There are inherent risks associated with viewing wildlife (both marine and on land),
            particularly on foot or at close range. Always maintain a safe distance when observing
            wildlife and avoid leaving the vehicle unless it is deemed safe to do so by professional
            guides and wardens. Use only reputable and professional guides or tour operators, and
            closely follow park regulations and wardens’ advice.

            Coastal areas of southeastern Sabah (see Advisory)

            Clashes between Philippine gunmen and Malaysian authorities occurred from February to
            March 2013, resulting in several deaths. This area was declared a Special Security Area
            by the Malaysian government. Monitor local media and follow the advice of local
            authorities.

            Despite increased security in the region, the risk of kidnapping and violence
            perpetrated by Philippine militants remains, especially on resort islands and
            surrounding waters, including around Sipadan. Violent incidents occur regularly. On July
            12, 2014, gunmen opened fire at a dive resort on the island of Mabul, killing a police
            officer and kidnapping another. On April 2, 2014, a foreigner and a local employee were
            abducted from a resort on the island of Singamata. On November 15, 2013, a foreign
            couple was attacked in a resort on the island of Pom Pom; one was murdered and the other
            was abducted. Foreigners were also kidnapped in 2000 and 2003.
            Crime

            Violent crime against foreigners is uncommon. Petty crime is prevalent, especially in
            tourist areas and at the airport. Snatch-and-grab incidents against tourists occur.
            Thieves on motorcycles frequently grab bags and other valuables from pedestrians, often
            resulting in injury. Women walking alone or with children are common targets. Ensure
            that your personal belongings, passports and other travel documents are secure at all
            times. Do not leave valuables unattended in vehicles.

            Be particularly cautious at bars or clubs. Never leave food or drinks unattended or in
            the care of strangers. Be wary of accepting snacks, beverages, gum or cigarettes from
            new acquaintances, as they may contain drugs that could put you at risk of sexual
            assault and robbery.
            Terrorism

            On September 21, 2014, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) released a
            statement threatening retaliation for the American-led coalition campaign against ISIL
            in Iraq and Syria. The statement encouraged opportunistic and indiscriminate attacks
            against citizens and interests of countries supporting the coalition, including
            Canadians. Individuals and terrorist groups in the region may be inspired to carry out
            attacks in a show of solidarity with ISIL. Canadians could also be targeted by a
            terrorist attack and be considered kidnapping targets. Exercise a high degree of
            personal security awareness, maintain a heightened level of vigilance and be aware of
            your surroundings at all times.
            Airport taxis

            Touts at Kuala Lumpur International Airport, including the Low Cost Carrier Terminal,
            attempt to get travellers to take their "taxi" into town. Several incidents of robbery
            and/or assault have occurred, as well as gross overcharges by such individuals. Take
            registered airport taxis only, after obtaining a coupon from the airport taxi stand near
            the door before exiting the customs and arrivals hall.
            Demonstrations

            Large-scale demonstrations have increased. Police permission is required for any public
            gathering or demonstration. Offenders could face lengthy jail sentences. Passersby have
            become victims of acts of violence during demonstrations. Avoid all political
            demonstrations and stay away from areas where they might occur. Protests can turn
            violent quickly and without warning. Demonstrations are usually accompanied by a
            heightened police presence and traffic delays.
            Transportation

            Traffic drives on the left. Road conditions are good. Aggressive driving habits by
            motorcyclists may pose a risk to foreign drivers who may not be accustomed to these
            competitive driving techniques.

            Review the Travel Advice for Thailand if you are contemplating overland travel from
            Malaysia to Thailand.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            Scams

            A number of scam artists operate within Malaysia. Male travellers, usually alone, have
            been approached in public places with invitations to participate in card games offering
            attractive opportunities for winning large amounts of money. Victims have lost thousands
            of dollars before realizing they were being scammed.

            There are reports of travellers encountering serious problems after responding to
            advertisements to do volunteer work with some adventure or environmental organizations.
            If you are interested in doing volunteer work abroad, conduct careful research before
            making a commitment.

            Internet dating and financial scams are common. Foreigners, including Canadian
            expatriates, may be targeted. Consult our Overseas Fraud page for more information.
            Credit card fraud

            Credit cards should be safeguarded at all times. Malaysia has one of the highest rates
            of credit card fraud in the world. Credit card magnetic strips have been duplicated,
            even in international hotels. Swiping your own card may not always be possible. Pay
            careful attention when others are handling your card during payment processing. Scams
            involving debit cards also occur. Before using your card, carefully inspect the
            automated banking machine to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
            Piracy

            Pirate attacks and armed robberies occur against ships in and around Malaysia,
            particularly in the Strait of Malacca and in the waters between Sabah and the southern
            Philippines. Mariners should take appropriate precautions. For additional information,
            consult the Live Piracy Report published by the International Maritime Bureau.

            Crime

            Populated areas may experience gang-related violence. Exercise caution and remain
            vigilant

            Petty crime is prevalent. Ensure that your personal belongings, passports and other
            travel documents are secure at all times, especially on the beach.
            Demonstrations

            Political and religious demonstrations occur, and may turn violent. Local media,
            political parties, and non-governmental organizations have been targets of violence.

            Political demonstrations have been occurring in Male following the arrest of a former
            political leader on February 22, 2015, and are likely to continue. Exercise particular
            caution in Male, especially at night. Avoid all demonstrations and large gatherings,
            monitor local media and follow the advice of local authorities. If you are planning to
            travel to possible affected areas, contact your airline or tour operator to determine
            whether the situation could disrupt your travel.
            Transportation

            Traffic drives on the left. Only a few islands have facilities for automobiles. Most
            transportation is by boat or seaplane. Motorized water taxis (dhonis) provide
            transportation between the airport, Male, and nearby resort islands.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            Tourist facilities

            Tourist facilities are well developed on resort islands, but are limited elsewhere.
            Water sports

            Rescue services may not be consistent with international standards. Several diving
            injuries have occurred, including one death, apparently as a result of poor equipment
            and poor monitoring of safety standards by local dive operators.

            Northern Mali (see Advisory)

            Armed rebels captured the northern regions of Gao, Tombouktou and Kidal in the spring of
            2012. MINUSMA, the United Nations peacekeeping mission in Mali, has been supporting
            authorities in stabilizing the region. While most of the Malian territory has been
            liberated, military clashes with armed rebels continue to occur in the northern regions.
            Kidnappings

            The risk of kidnapping is high throughout Mali, especially in the northern regions and
            in border areas.

            There is a very high risk of kidnapping in northern Mali, and Westerners are a preferred
            target. In past instances, some hostages have been detained for months before being
            released, and some have been killed. Most recently, a Red Cross team was kidnapped
            between the towns of Kidal and Gao in February 2014. In November 2013, two French
            journalists were kidnapped in the town of Kidal and subsequently killed.

            Use varied and unpredictable routes and schedules when moving from one place to another,
            exercise particular caution when travelling on highways, even in daylight hours, and
            avoid border areas.
            Terrorism

            On March 7, 2015, an attack occurred in Bamako at a restaurant popular among foreigners,
            killing five people and injuring at least eight others. If you are in Bamako, you should
            avoid travelling in urban areas after 7 p.m., especially in places frequented by
            foreigners, for the time being.

            MINUSMA, the United Nations peacekeeping mission in Mali, has been supporting
            authorities in stabilizing the situation in the northern regions. Terrorist groups in
            the region declared their intention to increase attacks and kidnappings targeting
            Westerners. Targets could include government buildings, public areas, tourist sites and
            Western interests. Citizens of countries supporting the military intervention are at
            particular risk, but all travellers should exercise increased vigilance.

            The presence of terrorists is reported in the northern regions of Mali and along the
            Mauritanian border.
            Ebola

            Screening measures are in place at entry points in an attempt to contain the Ebola
            outbreak.
            Demonstrations

            Demonstrations may occur and have the potential to suddenly turn violent. They can lead
            to significant disruptions to traffic and public transportation. Canadians are advised
            to avoid all demonstrations and large gatherings, follow the advice of local authorities
            and monitor local media.
            Crime

            Attacks by armed highway robbers (known as “coupeurs de route”) have taken place.
            Attacks can occur both during the day and at night. If you are considering travelling by
            road you should plan your journey carefully and take security precautions.

            Carjackings occur throughout Mali, especially in the North.

            Petty crime occurs. Panhandlers are common. Be careful of scam artists at the Bamako
            airport. Tourists should travel in groups, remain alert, ensure their personal
            belongings and travel documents are secure, and avoid poorly lit areas after dark.

            Corruption is prevalent. Police may stop motorists and request payments for unknown
            reasons.

            Food products are sometimes sold past their expiry date. Higher prices may be charged
            for merchandise bought in markets.
            Fraud

            Cases of attempted fraud are frequently reported in Mali. See our Overseas Fraud page
            for more information on scams abroad.
            Women\'s safety

            Women may be subject to certain forms of harassment and verbal abuse. Consult our
            publication entitled Her Own Way: A Woman’s Safe-Travel Guide for travel safety
            information specifically aimed at Canadian women.
            Transportation

            Exercise extreme caution when driving. Road conditions off major roads are poor. Driving
            standards, lack of traffic signals, excessive speed, pedestrians and livestock on
            roadways, traffic congestion, the absence of sidewalks and poorly lit streets all pose
            serious risks. Overloaded transport vehicles often break down and cause accidents. Many
            vehicles lack lights. Roadside assistance is not available. Avoid driving at night.

            During the rainy season, some dirt roads may be impassable without a four-wheel-drive
            vehicle. Vehicles should be equipped with spare tires and an emergency kit. Keep
            informed of regional weather forecasts and plan accordingly.

            Public transportation is unreliable in the capital. Determine taxi fares before
            departure.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            General safety information

            Remain extremely vigilant, follow the political and social developments carefully,
            register with the Embassy of Canada in Bamako and follow messages issued through the
            Registration of Canadians Abroad (ROCA) service. If the security situation in Mali
            deteriorates, the availability of consular services at the Embassy of Canada may be
            limited.

            Crime

            Violent crime is rare, although petty crime does occur. Areas frequented by tourists are
            often targeted.
            Road travel

            Traffic drives on the left. Drivers generally have little regard for traffic regulations
            and do not follow safe driving practices. Narrow, winding, congested and sometimes
            poorly maintained roads pose hazards.
            Public transportation

            Travel by taxi is safe. The fare should be confirmed before leaving.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            Water sports

            Strong currents make swimming dangerous at some locations.
            General safety information

            Exercise normal safety precautions. Ensure that your personal belongings, passports and
            other travel documents are secure at all times. Keep valuables and luggage out of sight
            in vehicles.

            The water supply may sometimes be disrupted.

            Crime

            Ensure that your personal belongings, passports and other travel documents are secure at
            all times. Break-ins and thefts from hotel rooms and vehicles occur.
            Transportation

            Exercise caution when driving after dark. Majuro has one paved road but there are few
            traffic signs and no traffic lights. Be careful of animals roaming the streets. Some
            roads flood after heavy rains.

            Majuro has a cheap shared taxi system and there are also minivan taxis that circulate on
            the main road.

            Flights are often cancelled.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            General safety information

            You are encouraged to register with the Embassy of Australia in Pohnpei, Micronesia, in
            order to receive the latest information on situations and events that could affect your
            safety.

            Tourist facilities and services are limited. There are a few hotels on Majuro and Ebeye.

            Demonstrations

            Demonstrations occur and have the potential to suddenly turn violent. Avoid all
            demonstrations and large gatherings, follow the advice of local authorities and monitor
            local media.
            Transportation

            Roads are paved and well maintained. Traffic safety is enforced by police. Night driving
            can be dangerous, especially in the mountains and on winding rural roads.

            Public transportation by van and taxi is relatively safe.

            ncreased threat of attacks and kidnappings

            In 2013, the French military assisted the Malian government in efforts to repel armed
            rebels. Terrorist groups in the region declared their intention to increase attacks and
            kidnappings targeting Westerners. While the United Nations peacekeeping mission in Mali
            has been supporting the transitional authorities in stabilizing the region since July
            2013, citizens of countries supporting the intervention are still at particular risk,
            but all travellers should exercise increased vigilance in the region.
            Northern and eastern parts of the country especially the desert areas north of the
            Oualata-Tichit-Ouadane-Zouérat line, and the border areas with Algeria, Mali and Morocco
            (see Advisory)

            Extremist groups and armed smugglers are active in these areas and there is a risk of
            banditry and kidnap. Armed Tuareg rebels are active in the northern area beyond the
            Oualata-Tichit-Ouadane-Zouérat line. Attacks and thefts of personal belongings and
            vehicles have occurred.

            Seek the advice of local authorities when planning land trips if you choose to travel to
            these regions despite this warning. Leave a detailed itinerary with family or friends
            and register with the Registration of Canadians Abroad (ROCA) service.
            Terrorism

            The threat of terrorism, which is present throughout the country, is heightened by the
            regional instability. The risk is high outside major urban centres. Maintain a high
            level of vigilance at all times.
            Kidnapping

            There is a high risk of kidnapping in Mauritania, and Westerners are a favourite target.
            In past instances, hostages have been detained for several months before being released.
            Be particularly cautious in the region of Inchiri (Akjoujt is the capital) as well as in
            areas bordering Morocco and Mali.

            Arrange for a trustworthy escort familiar with the country. Use varied and unpredictable
            routes and schedules when moving from one place to another. Exercise a high awareness of
            your personal security at all times, monitor local developments and contact the
            Consulate of Canada in Nouakchott for advice and assistance.
            Crime

            Petty crime such as pickpocketing, theft, and residential and vehicle break-ins occurs,
            as does assault. Avoid unpatrolled beaches at all times because of the risk of banditry
            and carjacking. Avoid beaches and "le Cinquième" district in Nouakchott after dark.

            Travel in groups, remain alert, and ensure that your personal belongings, passports and
            other travel documents are secure at all times.
            Demonstrations

            Demonstrations occur, particularly on Fridays, and have the potential to turn violent
            suddenly. They can significantly disrupt traffic and public transportation. Avoid all
            demonstrations and large gatherings, follow the advice of local authorities and monitor
            local media.
            Desert travel

            Be aware of the extreme conditions you may face if you choose to travel to the 20-30 km
            wide "no man\'s land" that separates Mauritania and Western Sahara. Unexploded landmines
            have been laid in these areas and can shift with the movement of sand and dunes. You are
            isolated after crossing police checkpoints located on either side of this zone. If you
            choose to travel to this area, travel in convoys, be accompanied by an experienced
            guide, remain on well-used tracks and carry sufficient supplies. You should also seek
            the advice of local authorities and leave an itinerary with family and friends.
            Transportation

            Road conditions are generally fair to poor. There are four major roads in the country.
            Three run between Nouakchott and Rosso, Nouakchott and Atar (through Akjoujt), and
            Nouakchott and Néma. The road between Nouakchott and Néma leads to the border with Mali.
            Trucks use this road to transport containers from Mauritanian seaports. A new road
            connects the cities of Nouakchott and Nouadhibou. Most other roads are unpaved sand
            tracks.

            Driving can be treacherous in Mauritania. Traffic laws and regulations are rarely
            respected. Vehicles may occasionally be forced off the roads by drifting sand and dunes.
            Roaming animals, bush taxis, poor driving habits and poorly maintained vehicles
            frequently cause accidents. Roadside assistance is non-existent. Wear seatbelts at all
            times. Avoid driving at night.

            Rent vehicles with drivers. In the event of an accident or vehicle breakdown, the driver
            and rental company will be held responsible. If the vehicle is rented without a driver,
            the person renting the vehicle will be held responsible. In the event of an accident, a
            police report must be filed. Should an accident result in injury or death, drivers are
            detained until a judge determines responsibility.

            Police conduct routine roadblocks in major cities such as Nouakchott. They may ask for
            proof of identity and a driver\'s licence.

            Public transportation is generally unsafe and unreliable.

            Passenger rail service operates between Nouadhibou and Zouérat. Book in advance.

            Sailing in the port at Nouadhibou can be dangerous because of the significant number of
            shallow shipwrecks.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            Border crossings

            There are two official land border crossings into Senegal: Diama and Rosso. Pedestrians
            and vehicles are permitted to cross over the dam at Diama, and by ferry at Rosso. The
            road leading to Diama may be impassable during the rainy season. Long delays at the
            border are common. Ferry crossings at Rosso are available only between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m.
            Do not cross the Senegal River by pirogue as it is illegal and dangerous.

            Reports indicate that some southern border crossings are closed until further notice in
            an attempt to contain the Ebola outbreak.

        <item>
            Crime

            Petty crime, such as pickpocketing, bag snatching and theft, has increased. Pickpockets
            are active in the central market in Port Louis and in crowded markets, in Grand Baie and
            in Flic en Flac. Ensure that your bags and personal belongings are secure.

            Residential break-ins are reported regularly.

            Exercise caution when withdrawing money from automated banking machines (ABMs) as
            robberies have been reported.

            There have been some reports of assaults and rapes. Avoid walking alone after dark
            outside hotel grounds and on beaches.

            Do not trek or hike alone.
            Demonstrations

            Demonstrations occur and have the potential to suddenly turn violent. They can lead to
            significant disruptions to traffic and public transportation. Avoid all demonstrations
            and large gatherings, follow the advice of local authorities and monitor local media.
            Road travel

            Traffic drives on the left. Some roads are narrow, uneven and poorly lit. Many are
            bordered by deep ditches and lack guardrails. Local driving habits and the presence of
            pedestrians on the road pose risks. Emergency and roadside assistance is limited. In the
            event of a traffic accident, drivers must remain at the scene until the police arrive.
            However, if you feel threatened, proceed directly to a police station. Car rentals are
            available and travellers should purchase sufficient car insurance.

            An International Driving Permit is recommended.
            Public transportation

            Public transportation and taxis are available between cities and to remote areas.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            Piracy

            Pirate attacks occur in coastal waters and, in some cases, further out at sea. Mariners
            should take appropriate precautions. For additional information, consult the Live Piracy
            Report published by the International Maritime Bureau.
            General safety information

            Exercise caution when swimming, particularly outside marked areas. Stonefish stings are
            unusual but can, in some cases, be fatal. You should get immediate medical attention if
            stung. Many hotels carry anti-venom serum.

            There is only one decompression chamber in Mauritius, at the Victoria Hospital in
            Vacoas.

            Aquatic equipment offered at the beach may not meet Canadian safety standards. Ensure
            that your travel insurance covers accidents related to recreational activities.
            Emergency services

            Dial +230 210 3894 for tourist police.

            Dial 999 in an emergency.

            Crime

            Although infrequent, petty crime such as pick-pocketing, purse snatching and theft from
            unlocked cars occurs. Exercise caution in crowded outdoor markets, parks and beaches.
            Ensure that personal belongings, passport, and other travel documents are secure at all
            times.
            Demonstrations

            Demonstrations occur and have the potential to suddenly turn violent. Avoid all
            demonstrations and large gatherings, follow the advice of local authorities and monitor
            local media.
            Transportation

            Located in the Indian Ocean, Mayotte is part of the Comoros archipelago. Mayotte is made
            up of two main islands, Grande-Terre and Petite-Terre, and several other small islands,
            including Mtsamboro, Mbouzi and Bandrélé.

            Taxis are the only urban public transport. It is possible to travel between the islands
            by boat. You should avoid boats that are in poor condition or overcrowded, as there have
            been incidents of boats capsizing in the past.

            Car rental agencies are also available. The road network is currently being
            rehabilitated, so it should be noted that road quality is still variable. In some spots,
            the lack of maintenance, lighting and traffic lights is deplorable.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            General safety information

            Tourist facilities are limited.

            France’s main telecommunications carriers operate in Mayotte, providing reliable access
            to the telephone network. Broadband Internet access (ADSL) has also been also available
            in Mayotte since April 2012, and work to improve the network is ongoing.

            Mayotte has all the traditional postal services; the post office is a modern and
            reliable institution.
            Emergency services

            Dial 15 or 02 69 61 86 86 to reach the police, 17 to reach the gendarmerie and 18 to
            reach fire fighters.

            Northern states (see Advisory)

            Shootouts, attacks and illegal roadblocks may occur without warning. Criminals
            especially target sport utility vehicles and full-size pickup trucks for theft and
            carjacking along highways. Avoid inter-city road travel in the northern states.

            Travel to and within Ciudad Juarez poses particular challenges and requires extreme
            caution.

            Exercise a high degree of caution when travelling in the city of Monterrey, avoid
            movement after dark and stay within the suburb of San Pedro Garza García.
            South-Western states (see Advisory)

            Criminal activity has significantly increased in the states of Jalisco, Guerrero and
            Michoacán. Illegal roadblocks and demonstrations have been reported on a more frequent
            basis. The deterioration of the security situation is particularly noticeable in the
            rural areas of Guerrero and Michoacán. The rapid expansion of vigilante militias is
            troubling, and there have been instances where such groups have fired at vehicles that
            did not adhere to their roadblocks.
            Organized crime

            In northern Mexico, particularly along the border with the United States, organized
            crime and urban violence affect security. Confrontations between organized criminal
            groups and Mexican authorities continue to pose a problem. This has led to an increase
            in illegal roadblocks, robberies, kidnappings and carjackings, including in the city of
            Monterrey.

            Heavily armed gangs have attacked travellers driving through Matamoros, Reynosa, and
            Nuevo Laredo in the state of Tamaulipas but also on several highways in the states of
            Nuevo León, Coahuila, Durango, and Sinaloa. Violence related to organized crime has
            increased in the states of Guerrero (including Acapulco), Sinaloa (including Mazatlán),
            Morelos, Nayarit, Michoacán, San Luis Potosi, Veracruz, and Zacatecas, and Jalisco.

            In some parts of the country, military and federal police forces have been deployed in
            efforts to combat organized crime and improve security conditions. They maintain a
            visible presence patrolling the streets, setting up roadblocks, and conducting random
            vehicle checks. Armed clashes between security forces and criminal groups do occur in
            certain areas without warning. You could get caught in the crossfire.
            Crime

            Crime rates in Mexico are high. Arrest and detention rates are low and contribute to
            high levels of criminality.

            If you are the victim of a crime, report it immediately to the Agencia del Ministerio
            Público nearest to the crime scene. No criminal investigation is possible without a
            formal complaint to Mexican authorities.

            Complaints must be made in person before leaving Mexico. You must present photo
            identification. It is especially important to report the loss or theft of your
            identification documents, both to Mexican authorities and to the nearest Canadian
            consular point of service in Mexico, in order to protect yourself should the documents
            later be misused.

            Law enforcement and police presence is often lacking near the border with Guatemala,
            particularly in the state of Chiapas.
            Theft

            Theft—including armed robbery, purse snatching, and pickpocketing—is common in Mexico.
            If you are threatened by robbers, stay calm and do not resist. Canadians have been
            injured while trying to resist armed robberies. You should be aware of your surroundings
            at all times, even in areas normally considered safe, and take precautions to secure
            your belongings and minimize your risk of becoming a target for thieves. Blend in, avoid
            wearing or carrying expensive jewellery, and carry only small amounts of cash. Keep your
            luggage secure at all times. In resort areas, leave your passport and valuables in your
            hotel safe, not in your hotel room or on the beach, while you are swimming.

            Foreigners have been targeted in assault and robbery incidents, which are often violent.
            Victims have been followed after exchanging or withdrawing money at airports, currency
            exchange bureaus (casas de cambio), and automated banking machines (ABMs). Avoid
            withdrawing or exchanging money in public areas of the airport. If a financial
            transaction is absolutely necessary, ensure only small amounts are involved and execute
            the transaction before exiting the customs area.

            Withdraw or exchange money at ABMs or exchange bureaus during daylight hours only, and
            inside reputable hotels and malls rather than on the street. Always conceal the keypad
            when entering your personal identification number, even if nobody else is around. Keep
            your credit card in sight when paying for goods and services.
            Assault

            Incidents of physical and sexual assault against foreigners have been reported, in some
            cases implicating hotel employees, taxi drivers, and security personnel. Avoid walking
            after dark, especially alone, and avoid deserted or under-populated areas. You should
            only frequent bars and nightclubs as part of a group and avoid separating from the
            group. In cases of sexual assault, police authorities will require a medical
            examination.

            Be wary of accepting snacks, beverages, gum, or cigarettes from new acquaintances, as
            they may contain drugs that could put you at risk of sexual assault and robbery. Avoid
            excessive alcohol consumption, and do not accept invitations or rides from strangers or
            recent acquaintances, as this can make you a more vulnerable target for criminals.
            Demonstrations

            Demonstrations and protests occur regularly. Avoid large gatherings, as they could erupt
            into violent incidents at any time. Demonstrations and roadblocks are common in Mexico
            City (including to and from the airport) and in the states of Guerrero, Michoacán and
            Oaxaca. Participation in political demonstrations by foreigners is prohibited and may
            result in detention, expulsion, and the denial of future entry into Mexico.
            Kidnappings

            Kidnappings, including the kidnapping of Canadian citizens (and contractors working for
            Canadian businesses), do occur in Mexico, affecting primarily persons working in rural
            areas, located outside the areas of stronger institutional control of police and
            government authorities.

            Kidnappers target both the wealthy and middle class. Foreigners are not specifically
            targeted but may be perceived as being wealthy.

            Express kidnappings, i.e. attempts to get quick cash in exchange for the release of an
            individual, occur frequently in large urban areas. The most common practice involves
            thieves working in cooperation with, or posing as, taxi drivers. The thieves force
            victims to withdraw money from ABMs with their debit or credit cards in exchange for
            their release. Victims are sometimes held overnight so that a second withdrawal up to
            the victim\'s daily bank withdrawal limit can also be made the following day. Avoid
            hailing taxis on the street and instead call a reputable taxi company or use the taxi
            services located at a major hotel.

            A common scam throughout Mexico is \'virtual\' kidnapping, where a perpetrator
            identifies a person who is temporarily unreachable by cell phone or email, and then
            contacts that person’s family claiming that they have kidnapped their loved one, and
            demanding an immediate ransom for their release. When the family members cannot reach
            their loved one in Mexico, they may assume that the person has been kidnapped, when in
            fact they are simply unreachable. Perpetrators may use social media sites to gather
            information about potential victims.

            Any kidnapping, real or virtual, should be reported to the police as well as to the
            Embassy of Canada in Mexico City or the nearest Canadian consulate.
            Scams

            Criminals posing as police officers approach tourists and ask for their passports or for
            foreign currency.

            Legitimate police officers have extorted money from tourists or arrested tourists for
            minor offences or traffic violations. If this occurs, do not hand over your money or
            your passport. Instead, ask for the officer’s name, badge and patrol car number, the
            location of the arrest, and the written fine payable at a later date. Should you feel
            the fine cannot be justified, proceed to the nearest Agencia del Ministerio Público or
            Tourism Office to file a complaint.

            Do not divulge personal information to strangers either in person or over the phone.
            Virtual kidnapping by telephone is a common practice in Mexico. Should you receive a
            call from someone demanding payment for the release of an arrested or kidnapped family
            member, remain calm, note the phone number of the person calling, hang up, and report
            the call to local police. Scam artists have also gathered information on luggage tags in
            hotel lobbies and later convinced guests to give them their contact information in
            Canada. Afterwards, they have called parents of travelling Canadians to report that
            their child has been detained or hospitalized and have requested that money be wired to
            Mexico. If this occurs, parents or friends should request the name and number of the
            caller and contact the Emergency Watch and Response Centre in Ottawa (see Help Abroad).
            Road safety

            Avoid road travel at night between cities throughout the country. Toll (cuota) highways
            are safer than secondary highways. Overnight, ensure that you only stop in major
            centres, at reputable hotels or secure campsites.

            Road conditions vary and can be poor in some areas. Dangerous curves, poorly marked
            signs and construction sites, roaming livestock, slow-moving or abandoned vehicles, and
            other obstacles pose hazards.

            Mexican driving styles and road safety standards are very different from those in
            Canada. Police do not regularly patrol the highways. Be prepared for drivers that fail
            to observe speed limits, indicate lane changes, or stop at red lights. Pedestrians
            should be extremely cautious at all times. Fatal hit-and-run accidents occur. Keep your
            car doors locked and the windows rolled up, especially at traffic lights, where you can
            be a target for criminals.

            In the event of a vehicle breakdown or roadside emergency, a highway patrol service
            offered by the Mexican Ministry of Tourism (SECTUR), called the Green Angels (Angeles
            Verdes), provides free assistance on all major toll highways from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. In
            case of an emergency, dial 078 or the toll-free number in Mexico, 01-800-006-8839.
            Scooter rentals

            The number of moped and scooter accidents involving tourists is increasing. Avoid
            renting from operators who do not provide insurance and who do not provide a helmet with
            the rental. Be vigilant while driving. Avoid driving on roads in disrepair and refrain
            from driving at night.
            Public transportation

            Although public transportation is relatively safe, take precautions in airports, bus
            stations, and the Mexico City metro, which are often very crowded and popular areas for
            pickpockets. Avoid travelling late at night and during rush hour, if possible, and
            exercise caution at all times.

            Canadians have been robbed on buses, usually at night. Keep an eye on your luggage,
            money, and personal documents at all times. Bus accidents occur frequently due to
            speeding, poor road conditions, and mountainous terrain. You should travel during
            daylight hours and on first-class buses only.

            Hitchhiking is not a common practice in Mexico and is not recommended.
            Taxis

            You should only use hotel taxis or taxis based at designated stands (sitios). In Mexico
            City, all government-authorized taxis have licence plates starting with an A or a B.
            Taxis from designated stands have both the logo of their company and the plate number
            stamped on the side of the car. Always ask the dispatcher for the driver\'s name and the
            taxi\'s licence plate number, model, and colour. When arriving at Benito Juárez Airport
            in Mexico City, you should only use airport taxis, after prepaying the fare inside the
            airport. Ask to see the driver\'s official identification.

            Scooter rentalsThe number of moped and scooter accidents involving tourists is
            increasing. Avoid renting from operators who do not provide insurance and who do not
            provide a helmet with the rental. Be vigilant while driving. Avoid driving on roads in
            disrepair and refrain from driving at night.
            Air transportation

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            General security information

            Monitor local news sources on a regular basis to learn about events that could affect
            your personal safety. Leave your itinerary and contact information with friends or
            family in Canada.

            On beaches, take posted warnings about swimming conditions seriously. Many beaches are
            not supervised or do not offer warnings. When in doubt, consult hotel staff.

            Ensure that the recreational activities you choose are covered by your travel insurance
            or by a local insurance policy, and that sporting and aquatic equipment is safe and in
            good condition, especially for scuba diving. Many operators do not conduct regular
            safety checks. Canadians have been involved in accidents in the past where operators of
            recreational vehicles such as scooters and watercrafts demanded compensation in excess
            of the value of the damage caused to the vehicle or equipment.

            Exercise caution when standing close to balcony railings, as falls have resulted in
            deaths and injuries.

            Height standards for balcony railings in Mexico can be considerably lower than those in
            Canada.

            For emergency services, dial 060 or 066.

            Crime

            Petty crime occurs, particularly house break-ins. Ensure that doors are locked while you
            are away, and that your personal belongings, passports and other travel documents are
            secure at all times.
            Women’s safety

            Women should avoid walking or jogging alone at night or in the early morning. Consult
            our publication entitled Her Own Way: A Woman’s Safe-Travel Guide for travel safety
            information specifically aimed at Canadian women.
            Transportation

            Most roads are in poor condition. Roads outside towns are often unpaved. Street lights
            are rare. Many drivers do not follow safe driving practices.

            There is a public bus system on the island of Yap and rental cars are available. Shared
            taxis are available; however, most cars are poorly maintained, and services on the
            weekend and in the evening can be sporadic and unreliable. Travel between islands is
            done by boat.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            General safety information

            You are encouraged to register with the Embassy of Australia in Pohnpei in order to
            receive the latest information on situations and events that could affect your safety.

            Tourist facilities and services are limited.

            Exercise caution when swimming offshore due to dangerous currents.

            Transnistria (see Regional Advisory)

            Transnistria is not under Moldovan government control and the security situation is
            unstable and unpredictable. There are frequent checkpoints. As there is no Canadian
            government office in Moldova, Canadian officials may not be in a position to provide
            consular assistance to Canadians in this region.
            Crime

            Petty crime such as pickpocketing and purse snatching occurs, particularly in the
            capital, Chişinău. Theft on trains and from hotel rooms is common. Violent crime can
            occur as well. Do not travel alone after dark.
            Organized crime

            Organized crime is widespread. Criminal groups are active in casinos and nightclubs and
            are involved in prostitution.
            Fraud and scams

            Exercise caution when using automated banking machines (ABMs). Personal identification
            numbers have been stolen, and some travellers have reported unauthorized withdrawals
            from their accounts after using ABMs.

            Beware of Internet fraud and scams, which can range from product purchases to Internet
            romances. Incidents of police requesting a bribe have been reported. While you may be
            delayed if you refuse to pay the bribe, there have been few reports of problems beyond
            inconvenience. Report any such incident to the Embassy of Canada to Romania in
            Bucharest.

            See our Overseas Fraud page for more information on scams abroad.
            Road travel

            Roads are poorly maintained and rarely lit. Avoid driving after dark. Accidents are
            common and often involve drunk drivers. Be aware of farm vehicles, livestock and other
            hazards.

            Be cautious when crossing streets, as drivers do not always give pedestrians the right
            of way.
            Public transportation

            Arrange to be met at the airport or use officially marked taxis. Do not share taxis with
            strangers. Establish a rate or a fixed price before starting the journey to avoid
            excessive fees.

            Train and bus service is below Western standards. Trains are often unheated and prone to
            cancellation. Some travellers have reported theft on trains. Do not leave your
            compartment unattended, and ensure that the door is secured from the inside. Theft on
            buses has also been reported.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            Demonstrations

            Demonstrations occur and have the potential to suddenly turn violent. Avoid all
            demonstrations and large gatherings, follow the advice of local authorities and monitor
            local media.
            Spiked food and drinks

            Never leave food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers. Be wary of accepting
            snacks, beverages, gum or cigarettes from new acquaintances, as the items may contain
            drugs that could put you at risk of sexual assault and robbery.
            General safety information

            Exercise normal safety precautions. Ensure that your personal belongings and passport
            and other travel documents are secure at all times. Avoid showing signs of affluence and
            carrying large sums of cash.

            Always carry adequate identification, as police are entitled to request it at any time.
            Keep a photocopy of your passport in case of loss or seizure.
            Emergency services

            Dial 902 for police, 901 for fire fighters and 903 for an ambulance. Most dispatchers
            speak only Romanian or Russian.

            Crime

            The crime rate is lower than in most European countries. Nevertheless, be vigilant in
            public places, tourist areas and at the Monaco train station, where petty crimes
            (pickpocketing, purse snatching and theft from cars) may occur.
            Public transportation

            Taxis are plentiful. Rental cars are widely available.

            The local bus system is inexpensive and convenient and stops at most tourist
            attractions.

            A train connects Monaco with Nice (France), where the nearest airport is located. The
            principality is served by commuter train between Nice to the west and the Italian border
            to the east, and is also linked to France and Italy by high-speed trains, including the
            TGV.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            General safety information

            Exercise normal safety precautions. Ensure that personal belongings, passports and other
            travel documents are secure at all times. Do not leave your valuables in an unattended
            vehicle.

            Theft of passports or other important documents should be reported to the nearest police
            station or Sûreté publique.

            Crime

            Violent crime occurs, even in daylight and on busy streets. Foreigners are increasingly
            the target of street crime, especially in Ulaanbaatar and other major cities and in
            tourist areas. Cases of assault and robbery significantly increase in the weeks leading
            up to major local holidays in Ulaanbaatar. After dark, stick to well-lighted busy
            streets and do not walk alone.

            Passengers have been robbed, sometimes violently, by taxi drivers or by thieves waiting
            for them as they step out of a taxi. Use a reliable taxi company in Ulaanbaatar, as
            regular taxis (private cars without taxi signs) are unsafe. For a list of reliable
            companies, contact the Embassy of Canada in Ulaanbaatar.

            Be particularly cautious in the area surrounding the State Department Store in
            Ulaanbaatar, where foreigners have been mugged. Beware of pickpockets.

            Foreigners have also been robbed by individuals posing as police officers, particularly
            in the Sukhbaatar Square area. If approached, ask to see police credentials or offer to
            go to the police station. Exercise caution in crowded areas, including open-air markets,
            the central post office and the Gandan Monastery, as well as when using public
            transportation.

            Individual travellers have been harassed at border crossings. Thefts occur frequently on
            trains between Mongolia and Russia.

            Foreign companies have received threats of violence.
            Demonstrations

            Demonstrations occur and have the potential to suddenly turn violent. Avoid all
            demonstrations and be vigilant in areas where there are large crowds and gatherings.
            Transportation

            Traffic drives on the right. Road conditions are poor. Driving can be hazardous,
            especially in rural areas. Drivers have little regard for traffic regulations and do not
            follow safe driving practices. Accidents occur frequently. Access to rural areas can be
            hampered by heavy snowfalls during the winter months.

            The use of public transportation and regular taxis is considered to be unsafe. Contact
            the Embassy of Canada for advice on reliable taxi services. Use licensed taxis equipped
            with meters, regardless of the distance of the journey. Make arrangements for taxi
            service through your hotel.

            Area bordering Kosovo and southern border

            You should exercise caution in the border area with Kosovo and avoid all areas of
            security force activities along the southern border. The only official entry/exit point
            into Kosovo is the Kula pass (Rozaje-Pec road).
            Crime

            The incidence of street crime is similar to that elsewhere in Europe, particularly in
            large urban centres. Pickpocketing may occur on public transportation and in other
            public places.

            Four-wheel-drive and luxury vehicles are targeted by car thieves more than other models.
            Use common sense in determining the need to drive with car windows closed and doors
            locked.
            Demonstrations

            Demonstrations occur from time to time, especially in the vicinity of official
            buildings. Avoid all demonstrations and large gatherings, follow the advice of local
            authorities and monitor local and international media.
            Road travel

            Most roads are poorly maintained and secondary roads are narrow. The Moraca Canyon road
            is dangerous due to poor road conditions and traffic congestion. Expect delays due to
            road construction.
            Public transportation

            Public transportation is congested. Railway equipment is old. Trains are slow and often
            subject to delays. A number of companies offer domestic and international bus services.
            The larger firms have modern, well-maintained fleets.

            Use only officially marked taxis and negotiate fares in advance.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            General safety information

            Ensure that your personal belongings, passports and other travel documents are secure at
            all times, particularly on public transportation and in large crowds or public markets.
            Do not show signs of affluence or carry large sums of money.
            Emergency services

            Dial 122 for police, 123 for fire fighters and 124 for ambulance.

            Road travel

            The Belham Valley should be avoided during and after heavy rainfall due to the
            possibility of mudflows. Driving after dark and in the more mountainous regions should
            be done with caution due to steep, narrow and winding roads.
            Public transportation

            The ferry service from Antigua to Montserrat reopened on November 1, 2013, and currently
            operates five days per week. There are four daily flights to Antigua from the island
            airport. A helicopter service operates from V.C. Bird International Airport in Antigua
            to Gerald’s Heliport in Montserrat.

            Increased threat of attacks and kidnappings

            In 2013, the French military assisted the Malian government in efforts to repel armed
            rebels. Terrorist groups in the region declared their intention to increase attacks and
            kidnappings targeting Westerners. While the United Nations peacekeeping mission in Mali
            has been supporting the transitional authorities in stabilizing the region since July
            2013, citizens of countries supporting the intervention are still at particular risk,
            but all travellers should exercise increased vigilance in the region.
            Western Sahara and border regions

            Western Sahara is a non-autonomous territory whose political and legal status has yet to
            be determined through the United Nations. Although the Government of Canada does not
            recognize Moroccan sovereignty over Western Sahara, you are subject to the laws and
            regulations of Morocco, which unilaterally administers the territory. Because of the
            remoteness of Western Sahara, the Government of Canada may be extremely limited in its
            ability to provide assistance in this region.

            Restrict travel to officially designated tourist areas if you choose to travel to this
            area. Western Sahara is a former area of conflict still littered with unexploded
            landmines, particularly in remote regions. Seek local advice prior to travelling to the
            desert areas in the south and hire only official guides recommended by hotels, travel
            agencies or local tourist authorities. A four-wheel-drive vehicle and appropriate
            supplies are essential for off-road driving in the mountains or the desert.
            Terrorism

            There is a general threat of terrorism in Morocco and past attacks have targeted
            foreigners. On April 28, 2011, a terrorist attack at a restaurant on Jemaa el Fna
            Square, a popular tourist site in Marrakech, resulted in several deaths and numerous
            injuries. Exercise caution in public places, monitor local news reports, avoid
            demonstrations and follow the advice of local authorities.
            Kidnapping

            There is a general threat of kidnapping in the border and remote regions of Morocco.
            Maintain a high level of vigilance at all times, especially when travelling in the
            southern and border areas of Morocco.
            Demonstrations

            Demonstrations occur and have the potential to suddenly turn violent. Demonstrations
            take place mainly on Friday afternoons and on Sundays. They can lead to significant
            disruptions to traffic and public transportation. Avoid all demonstrations and large
            gatherings, follow the advice of local authorities and monitor local media.
            Women’s safety

            Women travelling alone may be subject to certain forms of harassment and verbal abuse.

            safety information specifically aimed at Canadian women.
            Crime

            Petty crimes—notably pickpocketing, purse snatchings (sometimes by motorcyclists), scams
            and other thefts—take place frequently in the medina, market areas, in parks and on
            beaches. Thefts occur around automated banking machines. Credit card fraud is also
            frequent. Panhandling is increasing and some panhandlers can be aggressive toward
            tourists. Ensure that your personal belongings are secure and do not show signs of
            affluence, particularly when walking at night.

            Do not accept food, drink or invitations from strangers, or change your planned
            itinerary at their request. While Moroccans are generally very friendly and hospitable,
            you should always exercise common sense and travel wisely.

            There have been reports of tourists being taken to certain stores and intimidated into
            making purchases. Stay on major roads, especially in the medinas, exercise caution and
            politely but firmly decline.

            Exercise caution in the mountainous Rif region, on the northern coast of Morocco, since
            drugs are produced in this area and tourists are occasionally tricked into unknowingly
            committing drug offences.
            Transportation

            Road conditions vary according to location and weather (for example, in the high
            mountains or during the rainy season). National roads are generally in good condition
            but narrow and heavily congested. Driving is generally easier on the highways.

            Morocco has a very high traffic mortality rate. Despite police enforcement, traffic
            regulations are not respected by all drivers. Pedestrians, scooters and animals on
            roadways can also pose risks. Avoid driving at night.

            If an accident occurs, first ensure your personal safety, but avoid moving the vehicles
            before the police arrive, if at all possible, even if this makes the traffic jams worse.
            If no one has been hurt, an accident report drawn up by the parties involved will
            suffice.

            Carry your identification and vehicle documents at all times, as checkpoints are
            frequent.

            Be extremely careful when driving on the Rabat–Casablanca highway, and on certain
            national highways because of high traffic volume. Accidents, which are numerous and
            often attributed to poor driving practices, have resulted in serious injuries and
            deaths.

            The rail network is developed, reliable and safe.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            Border areas

            The border with Algeria is closed. Do not attempt to cross into Algeria by land.
            Internet romances

            Exercise caution if travelling to Morocco for romance, especially in cases of
            relationships initiated on the Internet. Find out beforehand about the country’s customs
            and laws on conjugal relations and marriage. Ensure that you hold on to your return
            plane ticket, your money and your passport in case problems arise.

            For more information, consult our Marriage Overseas FAQ and our Overseas Fraud page.
            General safety information

            While swimming conditions in tourist areas are generally safe and problem-free, public
            beaches in major cities are often polluted and unfit for swimming. Check with your hotel

            Crime

            Violent crime is the most significant threat to visitors. Frequent crimes include armed
            robbery, armed carjacking and home burglaries. Carjacking is common in Maputo and on
            roads to Mutare, in Zimbabwe, and to South Africa. In 2013, there have been several
            reported incidents of carjackings in Boane, and near border crossings with Swaziland, by
            individuals impersonating police officers. Be aware that only officers from the Policia
            de Republica de Moçambique have the authority to establish checkpoints. Official
            checkpoints are always staffed by four officers and a clearly visible vehicle. Take
            precautions when being flagged at checkpoints.

            Petty crime, such as muggings, purse snatchings and pickpocketing, is particularly
            prevalent in Maputo and is on the rise in other urban and rural areas. Pedestrians and
            joggers have been frequently targeted, even during daylight hours.

            Crime increases significantly during the Christmas and New Year season.
            Kidnappings

            Cases of kidnapping take place primarily in larger cities, especially Maputo and Matola.
            Individuals perceived as wealthy, including foreigners, tend to be preferred targets. Be
            extremely vigilant at all times, avoid displaying signs of affluence, consider regularly
            modifying your patterns of travel, and be aware of your surroundings at all times.
            Demonstrations

            Mozambique is generally peaceful. However, violent demonstrations occurred in a few
            large cities in February 2008 and September 2010. These violent events, strongly
            repressed by law enforcement, erupted in response to increases in bread, transportation
            and utilities prices. Spontaneous roadblocks and rioting paralyzed Maputo and other
            large cities for many days. Efforts to contain the demonstrations caused injuries and
            deaths because the authorities were unprepared and ill-equipped. If such unrest should
            recur, you should exercise caution, monitor local news reports and avoid large
            gatherings.
            Road travel

            Traffic drives on the left. Travel in convoy is recommended. Overland travel after dark
            is not recommended. Third-party insurance is required and may be obtained at ports of
            entry.

            A four-wheel-drive vehicle may be required for travel outside cities and off major
            highways due to poor road conditions, especially during the rainy season (November to
            March). Carjackings have been reported in border areas and in rural regions,
            particularly on routes to Mutare, Zimbabwe, and to South Africa, especially in Moamba.

            Checkpoints are common and you should obey police when asked to stop. Police have been
            known to solicit bribes.

            Due to residual landmines, remain on official roads. Overland travel should be
            undertaken during daylight hours. Contact the High Commission of Canada in Maputo for
            the latest security and travel information.
            Public transportation

            Public transportation is very limited. Domestic rail service is overcrowded, slow and
            uncomfortable.

            Consult our Transportation FAQ in order to verify if national airlines meet safety
            standards.
            General safety information

            General elections took place on October 15, 2014. The opposition is contesting the
            results. Remain vigilant, avoid demonstrations and follow the advice of local
            authorities.

            Mozambique occasionally experiences fuel shortages. You should always keep stores of
            fuel on hand and plan all overland travel in advance.

            Carry identity documents at all times and be aware of the rules governing your entry
            visas. Urban streets are patrolled by police who frequently carry automatic weapons and
            require visitors to produce identity and travel documents.

            There are certain areas in the city of Maputo where pedestrian traffic is not tolerated,
            most notably in front of the presidential palaces.

            Facilities for tourism are steadily improving in Maputo but remain limited in other
            areas. Check the level of security provided at the hotel or accommodation you are
            contemplating before making reservations.

            Communications are generally good in Maputo but poor in rural areas.

            Crime

            Petty crime such as pickpocketing and purse snatching is prevalent. Vehicle theft and
            break-ins also occur. Violent crime, such as muggings and robberies targeting
            foreigners, has increased, particularly in Windhoek. Remain alert to your surroundings,
            ensure that your personal belongings and travel documents are secure, and avoid the
            townships and remote areas after dark. Avoid walking alone after dark. Keep your vehicle
            doors locked and windows shut, to deter carjacking and theft. Do not keep valuables in
            your car. There have been reports of thefts from vehicles at service stations.

            You should be cautious of persons ostensibly looking for assistance by the side of the
            road. Unsuspecting tourists have been victims of armed attacks.
            Demonstrations

            Demonstrations are rare and are concentrated in Windhoek. They can disrupt traffic and
            business. You should exercise caution and avoid large crowds and demonstrations.
            Landmines

            Be aware of the presence of landmines in the border area from Katwitwi (a village on the
            Okavango River in Western Kavango region) to Kongola (a town in the Zambezi region).
            Road travel

            Traffic drives on the left. Avoid night-time driving outside urban centres. Careful
            driving is particularly important on rural roads, many of which are gravel with sloping
            sand shoulders. Road conditions are generally good, but much of the country is covered
            by desert; overland travel takes considerable time. Sand, salt and gravel roads become
            very slippery when wet. Tourists are often involved in single-vehicle accidents. Do not
            exceed 80 km/h on gravel roads. Excessive speed and animals on the roadway pose hazards.
            Emergency and roadside assistance is unreliable or non-existent outside Windhoek.
            Overland travel via the Trans-Caprivi Highway between Rundu and Katima Mulilo should be
            undertaken during daylight hours only. Avoid stopping at roadside rest stops, where
            robberies have been known to occur.

            An original Canadian driver’s licence in English is accepted, but a valid International
            Driving Permit (IDP) is recommended. If hiring a car, pay particular attention to the
            insurance coverage provided: ensure you have comprehensive insurance.

            Road travel to desert areas should be undertaken with sufficient water and fuel supplies
            and two spare tires. Travel by convoy if you plan to go to the desert.
            Public transportation

            Buses and taxis operate in the capital. Public transportation is limited outside
            Windhoek. There have been reports of foreigners being robbed by taxi drivers. The
            Namibia Bus and Taxi Association (NABTA) regulates taxi drivers by allocating
            registration numbers (one letter followed by a two-digit number). Use registered taxis
            (displaying the NABTA logo) only or arrange for a taxi through a reputable hotel.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            Fraud

            Cases of attempted fraud are frequently reported in this country. See Overseas Fraud for
            more information.

            There have been reports of credit card copying in some hotels and lodges. When paying by
            credit card, keep your card in view at all times. Be extra vigilant at automated banking
            machines (ABMs), as criminals may attempt to distract you or offer assistance with the
            aim of stealing your money. Don’t accept any offer of assistance and cancel your
            transaction if you become suspicious.
            General safety information

            Avoid visiting townships unless accompanied by someone with local knowledge.

            When visiting parks and game reserves, remain with your group and observe all local or
            park regulations and instructions given by tour guides, as wild animals pose risks.
            Potentially dangerous areas may lack fences and warning signs.

            Carry a copy of your passport at all times.
            Emergency services

            In Windhoek, dial 211 111 for emergencies. If calling from a mobile phone, dial 112.

            Crime

            Petty crime occurs occasionally. Ensure that your personal belongings, passports and
            other travel documents are secure at all times.
            Transportation

            Traffic drives on the left. There are no taxis or regular public transport, but vehicles
            can be hired from local suppliers. The main road that circles the island is paved.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            General safety information

            You are encouraged to register with the High Commission of Australia in Nauru in order
            to receive the latest information on situations and events that could affect your
            safety.

            Tourist facilities and services are limited.

            Political and security situation

            Constituent Assembly elections took place on November 19, 2013. Ongoing political
            tensions may lead to demonstrations and very disruptive general strikes (bandhs), which
            could occur at any time and significantly affect transportation, both domestic and
            international. Avoid all demonstrations and large gatherings, monitor local
            developments, and follow the advice of local authorities.

            Although foreigners do not seem to be directly targeted for attack in Nepal, some
            attacks have occurred in places frequented by tourists and expatriates. Remain vigilant
            at all times and in all places in Nepal. In the past, violent clashes between political
            and ethnic groups in the Terai region resulted in several deaths and numerous injuries.
            The unpredictable nature of the attacks and demonstrations increases the risk.
            Crime

            Generally, attacks are not directed at tourists or foreigners, but there have been
            instances of armed robberies of tourists, particularly solo trekkers, and in tourist
            hotels. Some field offices of international non-governmental organizations have been
            targeted.

            Petty theft is common, especially near tourist sites, on buses and in hotel rooms. Do
            not leave personal belongings unattended. Exercise extreme caution in and around
            Kathmandu and other cities. Take particular care when walking around Thamel, a popular
            tourist spot in Kathmandu, where pickpocketing is common. Do not travel after dark.

            There is a significant increase in crime during the festival season, which extends from
            September to November, including thefts, purse and bag snatchings, pickpocketing and
            break-ins. Maintain a high level of personal security awareness and ensure that your
            personal belongings, passports and other travel documents are secure.
            Women’s safety

            Women are vulnerable to harassment and verbal abuse. Conservative dress is recommended,
            particularly in remote areas. Female tourists travelling alone are more at risk of
            violent attacks. Consult our publication entitled Her Own Way: A Woman’s Safe-Travel
            Guide for travel safety information specifically aimed at Canadian women.
            Demonstrations

            Protests and demonstrations occur. Activists stage demonstrations in Kathmandu and
            elsewhere in Nepal; some have led to violence in the past. Remain vigilant, monitor
            local news reports, and avoid large crowds and demonstrations.
            Strikes (bandhs)

            General strikes (bandhs) are a popular form of political expression. They can occur on
            short notice throughout the country, particularly outside Kathmandu, affecting access to
            services. While bandhs are usually peaceful, riots and violence are possible. During a
            bandh, businesses may close and transportation services may be severely disrupted. Road
            transport is often disturbed by strikes. Avoid travelling on public buses outside the
            Kathmandu Valley and urban centres during or immediately preceding bandhs, as tourists
            have been injured. Transportation to and from airports throughout Nepal could be
            affected. Army and police checkpoints are often encountered, especially at night. Follow
            the advice of local authorities and respect curfews and roadblocks.
            Maoist insurgency

            The Maoist insurgency, which ended in 2006 when a ceasefire was declared, led to
            instability, violence and widespread disruption across the country, including armed
            robberies, ransacking and destruction of premises, and threats and intimidation
            perpetrated by both the insurgents and the army. Although the country has been
            relatively peaceful since 2006, the threat of renewed outbreaks of violence on a more
            local scale remains.
            Transportation

            Traffic drives on the left. Exercise caution when travelling by road. Driving standards
            are poor and traffic laws are not enforced. Drivers often do not yield right-of-way to
            pedestrians. Many mountain and hill roads, which can be hazardous even in the best
            weather, are intermittently impassable during the monsoon season due to landslides.
            Traffic is congested in the Kathmandu Valley.

            Regular long-distance buses are often poorly maintained and accidents, often causing
            injuries and fatalities, are common. Avoid travelling on overnight buses. Tourist buses
            are generally safe.

            Road transport is often disturbed by general strikes. If you choose to travel in the
            countryside, be prepared for sudden delays and closures, and avoid military
            installations and Maoist cantonments.

            Boat accidents are not uncommon in Nepal due to the overloading and poor maintenance of
            vessels. Do not board vessels that appear overloaded or unfit, especially where there
            are strong currents.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            Trekking

            Emergency services such as evacuations and rescues from remote areas have been
            compromised by non-availability of helicopters on short notice, lack of immediate or
            positive response from insurance companies, and limited access to regular phone service
            in many trekking areas. Check with your trekking agency for updates on the security
            situation in the area.

            You must obtain a trekking permit before entering official trekking regions or routes
            such as those in the Everest, Annapurna and Langtan regions. Permits may be obtained
            from the Immigration Office after arrival in Kathmandu or Pokhara. For more information,
            consult the website of the Trekking Agencies’ Association of Nepal.

            Several Canadians have had fatal accidents while trekking. Many popular trekking trails
            exceed 5,500 metres. You may experience acute mountain sickness at high altitudes and
            should be well informed on possible hazards in the high mountains.

            Before leaving Kathmandu, check with the Himalayan Rescue Association for information
            about trail conditions and possible hazards in the high country.

            If you intend to trek:

            a) never trek alone;
            b) always hire an experienced guide and ensure that the trekking company is reputable;
            c) buy travel health insurance that includes helicopter rescue and medical evacuation;
            d) ensure that you are in top physical condition;
            e) advise a family member or friend of your itinerary;
            f) know the symptoms of acute altitude sickness, which can be fatal;
            g) register with the Embassy of Canada in Kathmandu; and
            h) obtain detailed information on trekking routes before setting out.
            Rafting

            Whitewater rafting excursions should be organized through reputable agencies only.
            Power cuts

            Due to an energy shortage, planned electric power cuts, termed “load shedding,” are a
            year-round occurrence starting from two hours daily during the June to September monsoon
            season to more than 12 hours daily toward the end of the dry season.

            Crime

            Violent crime rarely occurs. However, petty crime (pickpocketing, bag snatching) occurs
            in the larger cities, particularly in Amsterdam, where it constitutes a major problem.
            Tourists are frequently victims of robbery. Be vigilant at all times and pay attention
            to your surroundings.

            Thieves operate on trains and time their activities to coincide with train stops, for a
            quick exit. Victims who resist have been physically assaulted. Be particularly cautious
            on trains to and from Schiphol Airport.

            In Amsterdam, thieves are also active in restaurants, around the De Wallen district
            (red-light district) and at Central Station, as well as on public transportation,
            especially tram routes 1 and 5, between Central Station and the museum district.

            Organized gangs of thieves often use distracting techniques. Typically, a member of the
            gang will soil the victim’s clothes or ask directions while others rob the victim.

            Passports and other valuable documents are often stolen from youth hostels in Amsterdam.
            Terrorism

            On March 13, 2013, the Dutch Government raised its national terrorism threat level from
            “limited” to “substantial”. While stressing that there are no reliable indications that
            terrorist networks are currently plotting attacks in the Netherlands, the Dutch
            authorities have raised their levels of vigilance given their assessment that there is a
            realistic possibility that an attack will take place in the Netherlands. Exercise
            caution and maintain a high level of personal security awareness at all times and in all
            places. Consult the Ministry of Security and Justice for more information on threat
            levels.
            Spiked food and drinks

            Never leave food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers. Be wary of accepting
            snacks, beverages, gum or cigarettes from new acquaintances, as they may contain drugs
            that could put you at risk of sexual assault and robbery. Such incidents have been
            reported.
            Road safety

            Roads are excellent, although road congestion is common in areas around Amsterdam, The
            Hague and Rotterdam, where rail is a convenient alternative. There is a chronic lack of
            parking spaces throughout the country, and fines for illegal parking are severe.
            Public transportation

            Public transportation is excellent.

            Taxi service is generally safe but expensive.

            Trams and cyclists have priority over other traffic. Motorists and pedestrians must pay
            attention to cyclists and cycle paths. The centre lanes of many urban two-way streets
            are reserved for buses, trams and taxis.

            Rail is convenient in the areas of Amsterdam, The Hague and Rotterdam. Consult the Dutch
            website Holland by train for more information.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            Demonstrations

            Demonstrations occur periodically in larger urban centres such as Amsterdam, Rotterdam
            and The Hague. Avoid all demonstrations and large gatherings as they have the potential
            to suddenly turn violent. Follow the advice of local authorities and monitor local
            media.
            General safety measures

            Exercise normal safety precautions. Ensure that personal belongings, passports and other
            travel documents are secure at all times. Do not carry valuables or large sums of money.
            Do not leave baggage or personal belongings unattended in vehicles at any time.
            Emergency services

            Dial 112 for emergency assistance.

            Crime

            Petty crime is prevalent. Ensure that your personal belongings, passports and other
            travel documents are secure at all times.
            Demonstrations

            Demonstrations occur and have the potential to suddenly turn violent. Roadblocks and
            marches may occur on main roads at any time and with little or no notice. Avoid all
            demonstrations and large gatherings, follow the advice of local authorities and monitor
            local media.
            Transportation

            All main roads on Grande Terre are paved.

            Buses connect all major towns and villages. There is a ferry service between Noumea and
            other islands.

            Crime

            Street crime takes place in major cities. Theft occurs from hotel rooms, tourist sites,
            recreational areas and unattended vehicles. Ensure that your personal belongings,
            passports and other travel documents are secure at all times.
            Terrorism

            In October 2014, the Government of New Zealand raised its national terrorism threat
            level from Very Low to Low. Continue to exercise normal security precautions.
            Transportation

            Traffic drives on the left. Visit the website of the New Zealand Transport Agency to
            view its road code.

            Travel times by car are easy to underestimate, as roads can be narrow, winding and cover
            hilly terrain. Weather conditions can change quickly, particularly during winter. Snow,
            ice, fog, rain and strong winds can lead to dangerous driving conditions. Landslides
            caused by heavy rain can block or wash away roads. Mountain roads, including those
            leading to ski hills, may be narrow, unpaved and without safety barriers. The New
            Zealand Transport Agency and the New Zealand Automobile Association publish information
            on road closures and warnings.

            Be on the lookout for roaming animals in rural areas; dairy herds often cross main roads
            at milking time. Railway crossings may not have barriers, and bells may ring only during
            daylight hours, especially in rural areas.

            Public transportation is considered reliable and safe.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            Adventure activities

            Although many tourists participate in adventure activities in New Zealand without
            problem, serious accidents have occurred and some activity operators have been accused
            of negligence. Make sure to choose a reputable company.

            Ensure that you bring suitable and durable clothing and equipment on hikes. Obtain
            detailed information on trekking routes and weather forecasts. Leave a detailed
            itinerary with a friend or local acquaintance and consider carrying a personal locater
            beacon.
            General safety information

            Check with local tourist authorities before travelling to remote areas.

            Cellular telephone coverage may be limited in remote areas.
            Emergency services

            Dial 111.

            Crime

            Street crime such as pickpocketing and bag snatching is common, and tends to increase
            during holiday seasons such as Christmas and Easter. Use only hotels that provide
            adequate security.

            Remain alert when walking in markets, in the vicinity of the old cathedral in Managua,
            near Tica bus (the terminal for lines coming from Honduras and Costa Rica), at public
            transportation terminals and in poorer areas. Avoid the Mercado Oriental in Managua.
            Exercise common sense and ensure that your personal belongings, passports and other
            travel documents are secure at all times.

            Carry a photocopy of the identification page of your passport and a photocopy of the
            page that was stamped by local immigration authorities at the point of entry, and keep
            the original in a secure place. Do not carry large sums of money, especially while
            travelling on buses. Purse, backpack and jewellery snatching occurs while drivers are
            stopped at intersections and while pedestrians are walking on the street.

            Violent crime, including armed robbery and sexual assault, occurs in Managua, Granada
            and San Juan del Sur, as well as in Bonanza, La Rosita, Siuna and on Little Corn Island.
            Express kidnappings, in which victims are abducted for a few hours and forced to
            withdraw money from automated banking machines, also occur in these areas. If attacked,
            do not resist, as criminals often carry weapons and may become violent.

            There have been incidents, some violent, of passengers being robbed by taxi drivers or
            by people posing as taxi drivers using unauthorized taxi signs on their cars. Take taxis
            from hotels or from main entrances to shopping malls, and make detailed arrangements for
            the return trip. Use only taxis that have red plates and that have a circle on the door
            that says Cooperativa or taxi services ordered by phone. Arrange with the taxi driver
            not to pick up any other passengers on the way to your destination, even if it is more
            expensive.

            Police presence is extremely scarce outside of major urban areas. Restrict travel to
            tourist areas and to daylight hours. Hitchhiking in Nicaragua is highly unadvisable.
            Travel in groups whenever possible.
            Demonstrations

            Demonstrations occur occasionally and may cause traffic disruptions as well as threats
            to physical security. Clashes have occurred between law enforcement and protestors and
            between rival political groups. Incidents have involved the use of rubber bullets, rock
            throwing, tire burning, road blocks, as well as the burning of buses and other vehicles.
            Stay alert, avoid large crowds and keep informed of possible roadblocks.

            Periodic violence may occur on the streets, particularly in Managua, as a result of
            protests. Access to the Managua International Airport and to the area of Carretera a
            Masaya (where universities, shopping malls and restaurants are located) may be affected.
            Road travel

            Despite regular security patrols by the Nicaraguan Army and Police, armed banditry
            occurs in areas near Bonanza, La Rosita and Siuna (the Mining Triangle) in northeastern
            Nicaragua. Carjackings have also been reported between Managua and Puerto Cabezas.
            Restrict road travel in these area to daylight hours, and travel in convoys of at least
            two vehicles. Due to this type of criminal activity, only travel overland to Honduras on
            highways with official border crossings at Guasaule, El Espino and Las Manos.

            Driving standards are fair. Except for the Pan-American Highway, most roads lack
            shoulders, are narrow, potholed and poorly lit. Road signs are usually non-existent, and
            most streets are unnamed. Detours are common but are often not marked. Driving after
            dark is very dangerous. Roadside assistance is not available. Cell phone coverage
            outside urban areas is fair in the central and pacific areas, but can be lacking in
            mountainous areas and in the Caribbean. Keep your car windows closed and doors locked
            when driving through crowded areas.

            Vehicles, especially taxis and buses, are poorly maintained. Avoid using public
            transportation, which is overcrowded, unreliable and often targeted by pickpockets.
            Avoid conversations with friendly strangers and do not reveal your intended destination.
            Do not agree to share a cab at the end of a bus ride, and be cautious of any advice
            and/or shortcut that could convince you to get off a bus earlier than planned. There
            have been many instances of travellers being assaulted in such situations.
            Marine transportation

            The Caribbean and, to a lesser extent, the Pacific coasts of Nicaragua are known to be
            drug transit zones.
            Air travel

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            General safety information

            Exercise caution when swimming, as strong currents and undertows have resulted in
            drownings. Warning signs, lifeguards and rescue equipment are often lacking.

            Fraudulent tour guides have been known to operate on the island of Ometepe. Consult
            hotel staff and local authorities for information on reputable tour guides.

            Nicaragua does not have an extensive tourist infrastructure. INTUR, the governmental
            agency responsible for developing, regulating and promoting tourism in Nicaragua, offers
            some information in English.

            Niamey (see Advisory)

            Although the security situation has improved in Niamey, the threat of kidnapping is very
            present, as highlighted by the interception by Niger security forces of a terrorist cell
            within a few kilometers of Niamey in mid-August 2012. Evidence points to a kidnapping
            attempt. Remain extremely vigilant, limit your movement and avoid travelling after dark.
            All travel between the airport and Niamey must be done in convoy of at least two
            vehicles.
            Areas bordering Nigeria

            A state of emergency is in effect in the Nigerian states of Borno and Yobe, which border
            southeast Niger. Instability in these provinces could spill over into Niger.
            Terrorism

            The French and Nigerien militaries have been assisting the Malian government in efforts
            to repel armed rebels. Terrorist groups in the region declared their intention to
            increase attacks and kidnappings. Citizens of countries supporting the military
            intervention are at particular risk, but all travellers should exercise increased
            vigilance in the region.

            On May 23, 2013, two car bombs exploded simultaneously, one inside a military camp in
            the city of Agadez and another at a uranium mine in Arlit. As many as 26 people were
            killed and many others were injured.

            Bandits and terrorist groups exist in certain isolated regions of the country. Avoid the
            areas north of the Tahoua-Zinder-Diffa axis because of banditry and the risk of armed
            hold-ups.
            Kidnapping

            There is a risk to personal safety throughout the country. There are concerns about the
            risk of kidnapping by the group Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb. As a result of this
            risk, avoid all travel to isolated areas, particularly to the regions of Tillabéry,
            Tahoua, Arlit and Agadez, as well as in the border regions with Mali and Burkina Faso.

            Foreign nationals have been kidnapped. In August 2012, Niger security forces intercepted
            a terrorist cell within a few kilometers of Niamey. Use varied and unpredictable routes
            and schedules when moving from one place to another, remain extremely vigilant, limit
            your movement and avoid travelling after dark.
            Crime

            There is a moderate level of crime in Niger, including in the capital. However,
            muggings, armed assaults and theft can happen. In Niamey, pickpocketing and purse
            snatching also occur. Foreign nationals in particular are targeted.

            Avoid walking after dark and displaying any signs of affluence in public. Do not leave
            valuables or bags unattended.
            Demonstrations

            Demonstrations occur and have the potential to suddenly turn violent. They can lead to
            significant disruptions to traffic and public transportation. Avoid all demonstrations
            and large gatherings, especially those organized by students, workers or political
            figures, follow the advice of local authorities and monitor local media.
            Fraud

            Cases of attempted fraud are frequently reported. See our Overseas Fraud page for more
            information on scams abroad.
            Road travel

            Except for main routes, roads are generally in poor condition throughout the country.
            Local driving habits, bicycles, mopeds, pedestrians, roaming farm animals, slow-moving
            donkey carts, and broken-down vehicles pose hazards.

            Avoid travelling within the country unless it is essential. Undertake all travel during
            daylight hours, in a convoy of several vehicles in excellent mechanical condition and
            accompanied by an experienced driver. Bring sufficient supplies of food and water as
            well as a medical kit. Lock car doors and keep windows shut at all times. Carrying a
            satellite phone is recommended when travelling in remote areas. Emergency roadside or
            medical assistance is unavailable.

            Avoid all travel after dark. Nightime attacks on tourists have been reported in most of
            the country (on the roads between Agadez and Arlit, Agadez and Tahoua, in the city of
            Zinder, on the road between Tillabéry and Niamey).

            Do not leave the main roads. Landmines are present in the northern region of Agadez and
            continue to cause occasional injuries and deaths.

            In case of an accident, report to the nearest police station to file a report.
            Public transportation

            Public transportation is not recommended, including transportation organized by hotels.
            Consider hiring a driver for your stay in Niger.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            General safety information

            Carry identification at all times and safely store photocopies of passports, visas, and
            travel documents. Keep a photocopy of your passport in case of loss or seizure.

            Northern states of Borno, Gombe, Yobe, Kano, Adamawa and Kaduna, and Middle Belt states
            of Bauchi and Plateau (see Advisory)

            There is a high threat of terrorism in the northern states of Gombe, Yobe, Borno, Kano,
            Adamawa and Kaduna, where the extremist group Boko Haram, which often claims
            responsibility for terrorist attacks, is based. Boko Haram-attributed attacks, which
            regularly result in significant loss of life and injuries, increased in 2014. Explosions
            have taken place in busy public areas, including in or near markets in Jos, Maiduguri
            and Kano. A state of emergency is in effect in the states of Borno, Yobe and Adamawa.
            Additional security personnel have been deployed to these states. Curfews are in effect
            in Maiduguri and other cities in the northeast, and are subject to change. Consult the
            Terrorism section below for more information.

            There is a risk of foreign nationals being kidnapped in some northern states of Nigeria.
            See the Kidnapping section below.

            The states of Kaduna and Plateau are significantly affected by inter-communal violence.
            Frequent episodes of violent attacks occur in the city of Jos, located in Plateau State,
            and the situation remains unstable. Hundreds of people have died in violent clashes. Jos
            has also been the target of terrorist attacks perpetrated by suicide bombers.

            The borders with Niger, Chad and Cameroon could be closed on short notice.
            Niger Delta states (see Advisory)

            The security situation in the Niger Delta region is fragile and unstable, particularly
            in the states of Akwa Ibom, Bayelsa, Delta, Abia, Anambra, Rivers (with the exception of
            Rivers state capital Port Harcourt where we advise against non-essential travel).
            Election-related violence and unrest in Rivers State have increased and are likely to
            persist. Regional and ethnic conflicts between militant groups occur in the area, and
            have led to unrest and violence in the past. Militant activity has also been directed
            towards foreign interests. Armed groups have carried out successful attacks on oil
            facilities and workers, resulting in injuries and deaths. Incidents of armed robbery
            have also increased. Kidnapping occurs in the Niger Delta States. See the Kidnapping
            section below.

            Piracy is an ongoing threat in the Niger Delta states. Incidents of piracy, including
            attacks, kidnappings, hostage takings and ship hijackings are very common in this
            extremely volatile area. You should avoid the riverine and shoreline areas at all times.
            Insurgents in speedboats and equipped with high-calibre weapons operate along the
            coastal waters in the region. For additional information, consult the Live Piracy Report
            published by the International Maritime Bureau.

            If you choose to remain in the Niger Delta states despite this warning, you should be
            extremely vigilant at all times. If travelling for business, ensure that meetings are
            held at a secure location and that the contact is known to you. Seek the advice of local
            authorities when planning trips and leave a detailed itinerary with family or friends.
            Contact the High Commission in Abuja or the Deputy High Commission in Lagos for the
            latest security information and register with the Registration of Canadians Abroad
            (ROCA) service.
            Calabar and Lagos

            You are advised to exercise a high degree of caution in Calabar, the capital of Cross
            River State, where the security situation is stable and facilities are relatively well
            developed compared to the rest of the country. You are advised against non-essential
            travel to the rest of Cross River State.

            You are advised to exercise a high degree of caution in the city of Lagos, specifically
            within the area covering Ikeja in the north down to Lagos Island, Victoria Island and
            Ikoyi, and from Mile Two (west end of Lagos) to Chevron Estate on the Lekki Peninsula
            (east end of Lagos). You are advised against non-essential travel beyond this area (see
            Advisory). The level of criminality in Lagos is high and incidents of violent crime,
            including assaults and armed attacks, have occurred against foreign nationals and in
            areas frequented by foreigners. All unnecessary travel should be avoided after dark.

            If you decide to travel to these cities you should stay in secure, guarded
            accommodations and maintain a heightened level of personal security awareness at all
            times. Contact the High Commission in Abuja for advice on taking the necessary security
            precautions.
            Ebola

            Screening measures are in place at entry points in an attempt to contain the Ebola
            outbreak. Chad has closed its border with Nigeria.
            Terrorism

            There is a high threat from terrorism in Nigeria, particularly in some northern and
            Middle Belt states. Terrorist attacks, which can involve improvised explosive devices,
            gun fire and explosions, occur frequently and result in numerous deaths and injuries.
            Large-scale and small scale bomb attacks have occurred, including in Abuja, and some
            were coordinated to strike simultaneously in different cities. Targets have included
            Nigerian government institutions and security facilities, police stations, universities,
            schools, markets and places of worship. Terrorists have used vehicle borne improvised
            explosive devices to target churches and mosques in communities across the country, and
            inter-religious, retaliatory violence often follows. Attacks may increase during
            religious holidays.

            Further terrorist attacks are likely, and could target locations frequented by
            expatriates and foreign travellers, including government institutions, international
            organizations, large hotels, bars, markets, shopping centers and public transportation.
            In recent years, the Federal Capital Territory has been targeted by terrorists. On June
            25, 2014, a large explosion at the Emab Plaza, in a shopping district frequented by
            foreigners in Abuja, caused several casualties. Remain highly vigilant and avoid large
            crowds and gatherings when in public places in Abuja.
            Increased threat of attacks and kidnappings

            In 2013, the French military assisted the Malian government in efforts to repel armed
            rebels. Terrorist groups in the region declared their intention to increase attacks and
            kidnappings targeting Westerners. While the United Nations peacekeeping mission in Mali
            has been supporting the transitional authorities in stabilizing the region since July
            2013, citizens of countries supporting the intervention are still at particular risk,
            but all travellers should exercise increased vigilance in the region.
            Curfews

            Nigerian authorities have imposed curfews as a means to restore order after violence
            erupts in volatile areas. Curfews are currently in effect for the cities of Gusau
            (Zamfara State), Kano (Kano State), Maiduguri (Borno State), Minna (Niger State),
            Potiskum (Yobe State), and Yola and Mubi (Adamawa State). Canadians in affected areas
            are urged to limit their essential movements to daylight hours, avoid all public
            gatherings, keep a supply of basic foods on hand, monitor the security situation and
            closely follow the advice of local authorities, especially with respect to curfews.
            Kidnapping

            Kidnappings are a particular threat in the Niger Delta region and in southwestern
            Nigeria, but occur elsewhere in the country.

            Kidnappings for ransom targeting Westerners have increased in the affluent areas of
            Lagos and the surrounding states of Ogun, Osun and Ondo. Throughout the Niger Delta
            states, numerous Westerners, mainly oil and gas facility workers, have been abducted,
            and, in some cases, killed. Remain especially vigilant in Warri, Delta state. In Port
            Harcourt, Rivers state, you should avoid going to public places frequented by
            expatriates, including bars and restaurants, and avoid the waterfront at all times. The
            states of Abia, Anambra and Imo are at risk for kidnappings for ransom as well as
            violent acts. Recent events have demonstrated that attacks, often perpetrated by small
            groups of armed individuals, are indiscriminate. Residents and foreigners alike have
            been abducted and held captive, sometimes for days, until ransom was paid. Deaths have
            also been reported.

            Incidents of kidnapping of expatriates have occurred in the northern states of Adamawa,
            Kebbi, Katsina, Bauchi and Kano. Kidnapping for ransom of Nigerian citizens occurs
            regularly across northern Nigeria. Numerous mass kidnappings in northeast Nigeria have
            been linked to Boko Haram.
            Crime

            There is a high level of crime throughout Nigeria, including armed robbery, kidnapping
            for ransom, and violent assault. Criminal activity remains high in urban areas,
            including the city of Lagos. Robberies and muggings conducted by large, well-armed
            groups, in places frequented by expatriates, are common. Some have been committed by
            persons posing as police or military personnel. Incidents include armed attacks against
            foreign nationals and assaults in areas frequented by foreigners.

            Use caution when travelling to and from banks and be particularly discreet when using
            automated banking machines (ABMs).

            Before booking a hotel, ensure that sufficient security measures are in place. Check
            with local authorities to determine which hotels are safe for foreigners. Stay only at
            reputable hotels.

            House robberies are on the rise in Abuja, and remain a serious concern in residential
            areas of Lagos.

            Petty crime is common in crowded places, especially in public markets, as well as
            popular tourist sites. Should you visit the beach or sign up for a fishing excursion, do
            so only during daylight and in large groups, particularly those beaches in the vicinity
            of Victoria Island (Lekki and Bar beaches).

            Incidents of armed robbery and carjacking have occurred along main routes to
            international and domestic airports. (See the Travel to and from the airport section
            below).
            Transportation

            Across Nigeria, roads are generally in poor condition and lack adequate lighting.
            Excessive speeds and unpredictable driving habits pose hazards. All unnecessary road
            travel should be avoided after dark. Road accidents pose a serious risk and you should
            exercise great caution, especially when travelling on highways and outside major urban
            areas.

            Personal security and appropriate journey management should be observed as a very high
            priority. Road travel can be dangerous due to robberies and carjackings, which sometimes
            include physical violence. There have been reports of attempted armed robbery on main
            highways between state capitals. Carjackings have also occurred in main cities,
            including Lagos and Abuja. Many strategies may be used to stop cars on the road, such as
            nails being scattered on the road, or individuals, including pregnant women, pretending
            to be injured.

            Police checkpoints are very frequent on roads throughout the country. Abuse by some
            law-enforcement officers, armed gangs and others to extort bribes is common. This is a
            recurring security problem, especially along Nigeria’s borders. If you need assistance,
            you may contact the High Commission of Canada in Abuja.

            Rental cars are available in Nigeria, but should be avoided. Major hotels and the
            customer service centres at the airports in Lagos, Abuja and Kano offer reliable
            car-hire services complete with drivers.

            Public transportation is not recommended due to the risk of petty theft and armed
            attacks. Passengers in taxis have been driven to secluded areas where they have been
            attacked and robbed. However, if you must use a taxi, verify that nobody is hiding in
            the trunk before entering the vehicle. Locals have been known to hide in the trunk and
            then emerge through the back seat to rob the passenger once the taxi is in motion.

            Motorbike taxis, known in Nigeria as “okadas”, are a typical form of public
            transportation in many cities and are dangerous to motorists, their own passengers and
            pedestrians. In a number of cities, okada drivers and passengers are required to wear
            helmets.

            Arrange to arrive at the airport during the day and be met there by reliable contacts.
            Be extremely cautious when travelling to and from the airport. If transportation is not
            arranged by hosts or the hotel, you are advised to hire cars and drivers from reputable
            security providers with respect to journey management. Drivers should be experienced,
            have local knowledge, and be familiar with alternative routes. All arrangements should
            be made prior to your arrival in Nigeria. When arranging to hire a car and driver, be
            sure to agree on a price and all details before accepting.

            Incidents of armed robbery and carjacking have occurred along main routes to
            international and domestic airports. Also, be aware that criminals have posed as bogus
            greeters at the airport. Several incidents of armed robbery resulting in deaths have
            occurred at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport in Lagos.

            During the dry season, the Harmattan wind leads to high amounts of sand and dust in the
            air. Air travel within Nigeria can sometimes be restricted due to limited visibility.
            Occasionally, flights must be rerouted from their original destinations.

            passports, visas and travel documents.

            Remain discreet; avoid walking alone and displaying any signs of affluence in public.
            Valuables or bags should not be left unattended.

            Local telecommunications are subject to disruptions. Always carry a mobile phone. There
            are many mobile phone companies in Nigeria and it is the preferred method of
            telecommunications.

            The country experiences regular fuel shortages. Monitor local media sources for
            indicators of the circumstances that precede fuel shortages and ensure that you have
            adequate supplies on hand.

            Crime

            Even though the crime rate is low, petty crime (pickpocketing and purse snatching)
            occurs, especially in the summer tourist season from May to September. Remain vigilant
            in public places and tourist areas, including airports, train and bus stations,
            restaurants and hotels.

            Avoid poorly lit areas, especially the streets behind Oslo’s Central (railway) Station
            after dark.

            There has been an increase of rape and assault in Oslo. Authorities have increased the
            frequency of patrols and have made arrests. Remain highly vigilant, particularly at
            night and when clubs and pubs are closing. Avoid walking alone through parks and poorly
            lit areas of the city. Do not, under any circumstances, use "pirate taxis" or other
            unofficial transportation.
            Terrorism

            The Government of Norway maintains a public alert system on terrorism. Visit the website
            of the Norwegian Police Security Services for more information. Continue to exercise
            normal security precautions.
            Road safety

            Fraud

            Automated banking machine (ABM) card and credit card fraud occurs. Before using your
            card, carefully inspect the ABM to ensure that it has not been tampered with. One scam
            involves a unit placed on top of the card reader and then personal information,
            including the PIN, is used to access accounts.

            See our Overseas Fraud page for more information on scams abroad.
            Mountain activities

            If you intend to do mountaineering, glacier climbing or ski touring:

            a) never practice these activities alone;

            b) always hire an experienced guide from a reputable company;

            c) buy travel health insurance that includes helicopter rescue and medical evacuation;

            d) ensure that you are in top physical condition;

            e) ensure that you are properly equipped;

            f) advise a family member or friend of your destination, itinerary and when you expect
            to be back;

            g) know the symptoms of acute altitude sickness, which can be fatal;

            h) register with the Embassy of Canada in Norway;

            i) obtain detailed information on trekking routes or ski slopes before setting out, and
            do not venture off established trails, especially in early or late winter because of the
            possibility of snow avalanches occurring due to warming weather conditions;

            j) ensure that you are well informed about weather and other conditions, such as snow,
            before you set-off on a trip.

            Consider using modern communications tools, such as a mobile telephone or GPS tracking
            system, which can assist emergency response units in locating stranded travellers. Bring
            other safety devices such as a back-plate, a helmet and a spade for digging snow. If you
            feel that it is dangerous, remember that it is never too late to turn back.
            General safety measures

            Exercise normal safety precautions. Ensure that your personal belongings, passports and
            other travel documents are secure at all times.

            Terrorism

            Although Oman has not been subject to terrorist attacks, reports emerge periodically
            throughout the Arabian Peninsula that terrorists plan to attack specific locations.
            These are typically accompanied by a visible increase in the presence of security
            forces. Targets could include government buildings, public areas, areas frequented by
            tourists and Western interests. Maintain a high level of vigilance and personal security
            awareness at all times, particularly near the Yemeni border.

            On September 21, 2014, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) released a
            statement threatening retaliation for the American -led coalition campaign against ISIL
            in Iraq and Syria. The statement encouraged opportunistic and indiscriminate attacks
            against citizens and interests of countries supporting the coalition, which includes
            Canada. Individuals and terrorist groups in the region may be inspired to carry out
            attacks in a show of solidarity with ISIL. Exercise a high degree of personal security
            awareness at all times, maintain a heightened level of vigilance and be aware of your
            surroundings.
            Demonstrations

            Demonstrations may occur as a response to regional developments and socio-economic
            conditions. They can lead to significant disruptions to traffic and public
            transportation and may turn violent. Avoid all demonstrations and large gatherings,
            follow the advice of local authorities and monitor local media.
            Crime

            The crime rate is low and violence is rare, including against foreigners. Robbery and
            auto theft can occur. To reduce the likelihood of becoming a victim, do not show signs
            of affluence and ensure that your personal belongings and passports and other travel
            documents are secure at all times. Do not travel alone after dark.

            Lock car doors and keep windows closed. Do not leave vehicles unattended. Inspect both
            the exterior and interior of your vehicle upon return to detect any attached device or
            suspicious package.

            Treat mail and packages from unfamiliar sources with suspicion. Contact your visa
            sponsor or the police if you suspect anything unusual.
            Road travel

            Exercise caution when driving in rural areas, especially after dark, because of roaming
            animals, insufficient lighting and speeding drivers.

            In the event of an accident, wait until the police have made an official report before
            moving your vehicle, except in the Governorate of Muscat, where drivers involved in an
            accident must move their vehicles to the side of the road to reduce congestion. Anyone
            deemed responsible for a motor vehicle accident may be detained for 48 hours. Consult
            the Royal Oman Police for more information on traffic rules.

            Off-road driving can be hazardous. Undertake off-road driving in a convoy of
            four-wheel-drive vehicles and with an experienced guide only. Leave a travel itinerary
            with a family member or friend. Be well prepared and equipped with gasoline, water, food
            and a cellular phone if you are considering driving in the desert areas of Wahiba and
            Rub’ Al Khali.

            Exercise caution when using taxis.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            Piracy

            Pirate attacks occur in coastal waters and, in some cases, farther out at sea. Mariners
            should take appropriate precautions. For additional information, consult the Live Piracy
            Report published by the International Maritime Bureau.
            General safety information

            Carry identification documents at all times. Leave your passport in a safe place and
            carry a photocopy for identification purposes.

            Cellular phone coverage may not be available in some parts of the country.

            Karachi

            From June 8-10, 2014, Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan gunmen laid siege to the Jinnah
            International Airport in Karachi, causing deaths and injuries. Although airport
            operations have resumed, expect disruptions and flight delays.

            Karachi continues to experience unprecedented levels of violence, stemming mainly from
            the political situation. Although this violence is currently common in Orangi, Baldia,
            SITE, Liyari, Saddar, Liaquatabad, Korangi, Landhi, Shah Faisal Colony, Jamshed and
            Gulberg, it could spread to other areas. In response to spates of violence, various
            groups may call for strikes and protest marches, which tend to take place in the central
            areas of Karachi. These events could cause travel disruptions throughout the city and
            create the necessary conditions for additional violence. The June 3, 2014 arrest of the
            MQM political party’s leader, Altaf Hussain, in London, United Kingdom, may also lead to
            demonstrations and strikes throughout the province of Sindh, particularly in Karachi.
            Maintain a high level of vigilance, minimize your movements around the city, avoid large
            gatherings and demonstrations and stay away from areas where they may take place, as
            they could turn violent without warning.

            Since January 2010, a series of targeted attacks in Karachi has killed a number of
            activists from Pakistan’s various political factions. While foreigners are not targeted
            by these killings, they may face incidental risks given that these acts could trigger
            violent demonstrations and rioting in Karachi. Expect tighter security measures and
            increased police presence in the affected areas of the city.

            Express kidnappings have occurred in Karachi where the person is kidnapped for a couple
            of hours and forced to purchase goods and/or to withdraw money from an automatic banking
            machine (ABM).
            Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province and the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (see Advisory)

            The security situation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province and the Federally Administered
            Tribal Areas in northwestern Pakistan remains volatile due to sectarian violence and
            fighting between government forces and militants. Lawlessness is a serious concern in
            several areas. Bombings, shootings and mass demonstrations occur regularly, resulting in
            deaths and injuries. Curfews are sometimes imposed. The security situation in Swat and
            South Waziristan is particularly volatile. The military operations in these areas have
            caused a number of civilian casualties, including deaths.

            Leave the area if it is safe to do so. Avoid road travel through Swat to Gilgit and
            Chitral.
            Border with India (see Advisory)

            Tensions between Pakistan and India remain since the November 2008 Mumbai attacks and
            are susceptible to sudden increase. You could experience difficulties when travelling
            between the two countries and may risk being scrutinized if officials from either
            country become aware that you have recently travelled to the other country.

            A ceasefire is in effect along the Line of Control with India and at military outposts
            in the Karakoram Mountains, including the Siachen Glacier.

            Exercise caution as the situation remains unpredictable.
            Terrorism

            The security situation remains fragile and unpredictable. The terrorist threat remains
            very high. Terrorist attacks have occurred throughout Pakistan, causing many deaths and
            injuries. Heightened security measures are currently in place throughout the country.
            Checkpoints may be set up without warning.

            Suicide bombings, improvised explosive devices, and political assassinations were among
            the tactics used in these attacks. Some attacks involved detailed planning to maximize
            casualties by using multiple and consecutive explosions. Extremism, ethnic divisions,
            sectarian strife, regional political disputes, and the situation in Afghanistan are
            usually the reasons behind these attacks.

            Attacks have taken place in public areas, such as airports, hotels, markets,
            transportation hubs, Western-style fast food outlets, restaurants and religious sites,
            including places frequented by foreigners. Terrorists also target popular trekking
            sites, such as Nanga Parbat, in Gilgit-Baltistan. Use only the very best hotels that
            have stringent security, including metal detectors; however, no location should be
            considered free of risks. Avoid mosques and their vicinities at prayer times, especially
            on Fridays.

            Large cities, such as Karachi, Lahore and Peshawar, are particularly vulnerable to
            indiscriminate bombings and other attacks.

            Be particularly vigilant in the lead-up to and on days of national significance, such as
            National Day (March 23), Independence Day (August 14), the Islamic month of Muharram and
            the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha. Expect heightened security measures
            and associated disruptions during these periods.

            A court in the F8 market area of Islamabad was targeted by a terrorist attack that
            caused 11 deaths on March 3, 2014. The threat to foreigners in the capital has
            increased, and security has been reinforced at government installations in the downtown
            area of Islamabad known as the "Red Zone," at the Marriott, Serena, Holiday Inn, and
            Best Western Hotels, and at the Margalla Motel. Avoid the Centaurus Mall and the Kohsar
            market.

            Remain vigilant, keep a low profile, and continue to exercise caution while in Pakistan,
            particularly in areas regularly frequented by westerners.

            Exercise extreme caution at all times and follow the advice of local authorities. Report
            any suspicious-looking package or behaviour immediately to the nearest security
            authorities.
            Kidnapping

            There is a very high risk of foreign nationals being kidnapped throughout Pakistan.
            Kidnapping for criminal and political purposes is a rising phenomenon. A number of
            foreigners, including diplomats, journalists and aid workers have been kidnapped in the
            past. Some foreigners have also been killed. Maintain a high level of vigilance at all
            times and use varied and unpredictable routes and schedules when moving from one place
            to another.
            Demonstrations and civil unrest

            Demonstrations and civil unrest may occur and have the potential to suddenly turn
            violent. Deaths, injuries and widespread violence have been reported. The current
            political situation, ethnic and sectarian conflicts, power cuts, and the rising price of
            commodities are among the current causes of concern.

            Avoid all demonstrations and large gatherings, follow the advice of local authorities,
            monitor local media and minimize time spent in places frequented by foreigners.
            Crime

            Violent crime is a problem, particularly in Karachi. Armed robbery, random shootings and
            armed carjackings occur, mostly in major urban centres.

            Avoid travelling after dusk, particularly in rural areas where road conditions are
            unsafe. Make arrangements to be met at the airport, especially if arriving after dark.

            If travelling by car, keep valuable belongings out of sight, windows closed and doors
            locked.

            Petty crime is common. To reduce the probability of becoming a victim, avoid showing
            signs of affluence and ensure that your personal belongings, passports and other travel
            documents are secure at all times. There are reports that cell phones, credit cards, and
            passports are currently favourite targets.

            Cases of drugged food followed by robbery have been reported. Do not accept food or
            drinks from strangers, and do not leave food or drinks unattended in commercial
            establishments. Order only bottled drinks in order to maintain control of the situation.

            Extortion and corruption can occur in the business environment. Tribal and criminal
            groups are usually behind these actions. Report any extortion attempts to Pakistani
            authorities and officials at the High Commission of Canada in Islamabad.
            Forced marriages

            Cases of Canadians being forced into marital arrangements have been reported. Some are
            detained in Pakistan against their will and subjected to threats, intimidation and
            violence by family members. Passports have been retained by family members and some
            victims have been unable to return to Canada.

            Forced marriages are contrary to Canadian law. If you are in Canada and you believe that
            you are being forced to travel overseas or to marry, contact provincial social welfare
            authorities and the local police. You may also contact the Emergency Watch and Response
            Centre. In Pakistan, contact the nearest Canadian government office.

            For more information about forced marriages, consult our Marriage Overseas FAQ and our
            publication entitled Her Own Way: A Woman’s Safe-Travel Guide.
            Regional travel

            Avoid overland travel into Sindh province unless police are notified well in advance and
            are able to make the necessary security arrangements. Avoid rural areas of the provinces
            of Sindh and Punjab due to banditry.

            The province of Baluchistan, which borders Iran and Afghanistan, is notorious for
            cross-border smuggling.

            Travel to Hunza via the Karakoram highway only during daylight hours. Two drivers should
            be present if travelling by bus. Sections of the road are very narrow with precipitous
            drops and are sometimes partially obstructed by rock and earth slides.
            Trekking and climbing

            Use licensed guides and tourist agencies only.

            Avoid the disputed areas along the border with India (Karakoram Mountains). The
            following peaks are considered dangerous: Rimo; Apsarasas I, II and III; Tegam Kangri I,
            II and III; Suingri Kangri; Ghiant I and II; Indira Col; and Sia Kangri.
            Road travel

            Traffic drives on the left. Road conditions are poor. Roads are mostly unpaved outside
            major urban centres, narrow, crowded, and poorly lit and signed. Many vehicles do not
            have proper lights for night driving. Accidents are common. Four-wheel-drive vehicles
            are strongly recommended. If an accident occurs and you feel that your safety is
            threatened, leave the area and report the accident to the nearest police station.

            Do not use public transportation or taxis.

            Avoid rail travel as it has been targeted by rioters and terrorists in the past. Rail
            accidents have occurred as a result of low safety and maintenance standards.

            Crime

            Petty theft occurs in rural and urban areas of Panama. Violent crime is not frequent,
            but does occur throughout the country.

            Theft from hotel rooms occurs in both urban and resort areas. Stay in busy, reputable
            and well-protected hotels and always verify the identity of a visitor before opening
            your door. Ensure that your personal belongings, passports and other travel documents
            are secure at all times.

            Incidents of both petty theft and some violent crimes have been reported in areas
            frequented by tourists. Avoid displaying signs of affluence or carrying large sums of
            cash, and be cautious when withdrawing money from automated banking machines. Ensure
            that windows and doors are secure and locked in both private and commercial
            accommodations.

            In Panama City, high-crime areas include Calidonia, San Miguelito, Juan Diaz, Rio Abajo,
            El Chorillo, Ancón, Curundú, Veracruz Beach, Parque Soberania and Tocumen, as well as
            bus stations and shopping areas on Avenida Central. Some violent crime has been reported
            in the cities of Colon and David, as well as in some beach communities.

            Do not walk alone after dark and stay within well-known tourist areas. Remain vigilant
            in all public places, especially at airports and bus terminals.
            Demonstrations

            Demonstrations and protest marches over various social and political issues occasionally
            occur in Panama City near the university, and on main streets and highways. These
            demonstrations are unpredictable and could potentially lead to violence. Avoid large
            gatherings and demonstrations, and monitor local news reports.
            Road travel

            Poor road conditions, dangerous driving habits, and poorly lit streets and vehicles are
            hazards. Keep car windows closed and doors locked at all times.

            Night construction on the Pan-American Highway is frequent. Be prepared for possible
            roadblocks.
            Marine travel

            The southeastern coast of Comarca Kuna Yala, on the Caribbean, and Coiba Island as well
            as the entire length of the Pacific coast, are known as transportation corridors for
            narcotics. To visit the national park on Coiba Island, you must obtain special
            permission from the Panamanian Ministry of Government and Justice and the National
            Environment Authority.
            Public transportation

            Local bus travel within Panama City has improved in recent years; however, buses do not
            always follow a regular route. Panama opened line 1 of its new metro system in early
            2014, which currently runs from the Albrook bus terminal to the Los Andes commercial
            centre. When using public transportation, be aware of your surroundings and protect your
            belongings.

            Registered yellow taxis are generally safe if located at a taxi stand. Sharing a taxi
            with strangers is not recommended, and passengers should sit in the back of the vehicle.
            Taxis are not metered, and fares are calculated according to the number of zones crossed
            to get to a destination. Agree to a fare before departure, as many fees are inflated for
            tourists.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            General safety information

            Some beaches on both the Pacific and Caribbean coasts can be dangerous, as there are
            strong currents and undertows, and drownings have occurred. Most beaches lack sufficient
            rescue equipment and are not adequately monitored or marked.
            Emergency services

            Dial 104 to reach local police and 103 for firefighters. 911 will reach ambulance
            services; however, an ambulance may not always be available. There are also private
            ambulance services available on a subscription basis.

            Bougainville Island

            Be extremely cautious if you travel to the central mountainous area around the old
            Panguna mine on Bougainville Island. The general security situation in Bougainville has
            improved, however, the old Panguna mine remains a “no go zone.” You may be detained by
            local officials if you attempt to enter this zone. Your passports may be confiscated by
            the Papua New Guinea government if you are found without proper authorization. There are
            no tourist facilities in the area, and transportation facilities are limited. Seek
            advice from the Australian High Commission in Port Moresby prior to travel.
            Crime

            Law and order remain very poor in the Highlands provinces and in the cities of Lae and
            Port Moresby. Violent crime is a serious problem, and occurs often in urban areas such
            as Port Moresby, Lae and Mount Hagen. Exercise a high degree of caution, particularly in
            commercial and public establishments (hotels, clubs, restaurants, bars, schools, places
            of worship, outdoor recreation events) and tourist areas.

            Carjacking and armed robbery occur in Port Moresby and along the highway between Lae and
            the Nadzab Airport, especially in the Two-Mile and Nine-Mile settlement areas. There has
            been a recent increase in violent attacks on vehicles travelling on the Highlands
            Highway, particularly between Goroka and Kainantu. Remain vigilant while travelling
            these roads. Robberies are often accompanied by assault. Violence, including the use of
            firearms or machetes, is a serious risk. Avoid travel after dark if possible.

            Travelling alone increases the possibility of being a victim of a crime such as robbery
            or sexual assault. Tolls may be demanded at illegal roadblocks and assaults can occur if
            payment is not made. Arrange to be met at the airport, particularly when arriving in the
            evening.
            Women’s safety

            Sexual assault, including gang rape, occurs and foreigners have been targeted. Victims
            of any assault are encouraged to seek immediate medical treatment. Women should not
            travel alone and should dress conservatively in public. Consult our publication entitled
            Her Own Way: A Woman’s Safe-Travel Guide for travel safety information specifically
            aimed at Canadian women.
            Inter-ethnic violence

            Inter-ethnic tensions often lead to communal violence, particularly in the Enga and
            Highlands provinces and in Lae and Port Moresby. Criminals and tribal fighters are
            increasingly using lethal weapons.
            Trekking

            Be vigilant if hiking the Black Cat Track, in the province of Morobe, as an attack on a
            group of trekkers in September 2013 left two dead and several injured.

            If you are intending to walk the Kokoda track, travel with a guide from a reputable tour
            company and pay the required fee before setting out. Security incidents involving
            tourists have occurred. Facilities along the track are limited. Register with the
            Australian High Commission in Port Moresby prior to travel.
            Demonstrations

            Demonstrations occur and have the potential to suddenly turn violent. Avoid all
            demonstrations and large gatherings, follow the advice of local authorities and monitor
            local media.
            Transportation

            Traffic drives on the left. Road conditions are poor and driving can be hazardous,
            especially outside major towns. Avoid leaving personal belongings unattended in
            vehicles, and drive with windows up and doors locked at all times.

            If you are involved in a traffic accident, proceed directly to the nearest police
            station rather than remaining at the scene. Crowds tend to form quickly after an
            incident, and accident victims or on-lookers may attack those they perceive to be
            responsible.

            Travel on public buses, known as PMVs (public motor vehicles), is not recommended. The
            vehicles are poorly maintained and are a common target for criminals. Travel by taxi is
            preferable; however, determine your fare prior to departure. Hotel transport is a safer
            alternative.

            Flight delays or cancellations occur on a regular basis. Verify your flight schedule
            before departure.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            General safety information

            Tourist facilities are available in Port Moresby, Lae and Madang. Exercise caution when
            visiting isolated public areas such as parks, hiking trails, golf courses and beaches.

            You are encouraged to register with the High Commission of Australia in Port Moresby in
            order to receive the latest information on situations and events that could affect your
            safety.
        </item>
        <item>
            Demonstrations and civil unrest

            Occasional demonstrations, roadblocks, and strikes occur in the capital and on main
            highways. Local transportation services can be disrupted and violent incidents may
            occur. Curfews may also be in effect. Avoid large gatherings and demonstrations, and
            monitor local news reports. Do not attempt to cross roadblocks, even if they appear
            unattended.
            Crime

            Crime has increased in recent years, and some incidents involve violence. Armed robbery,
            car theft, and burglary occur. Ensure that your personal belongings, passports and other
            travel documents are secure at all times. Do not show signs of affluence. If attacked,
            do not resist. Petty crimes such as pickpocketing are prevalent in cities and on public
            buses. Checked luggage has been pilfered at airports.

            In Asunción, be cautious in both unpopulated and overcrowded areas.

            Incidents of kidnapping for ransom have been reported. Although foreigners are not
            specifically targeted, exercise extreme caution at all times, particularly in cities at
            night.

            Never leave food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers. Be wary of accepting
            snacks, beverages, gum, or cigarettes from new acquaintances, as they may contain drugs
            that could put you at risk of assault and robbery.
            Road travel

            Road accidents are frequent. Traffic laws are frequently ignored and road signs are
            often lacking. There is no roadside assistance on most highways. Roads in rural areas
            are generally unpaved and may become impassable during rainy periods. When travelling
            outside Asunción, avoid night travel, because stray animals and vehicles operating
            without headlights often pose threats. The number of traffic accidents tends to increase
            during the holiday season. Be particularly cautious during this period.

            Police checkpoints are common, especially at night. Carry identification and vehicle
            registration at all times. It may be difficult to obtain service in English or French
            from the local police.
            Public transportation

            Travellers using public transit sometimes fall victim to theft or other crimes.

            Taxis can be hailed on the street or found at ranks. After dark, however, they should be
            ordered by phone. Very few taxi drivers speak English or French.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            General security information

            Tourist facilities are good in the capital but may be limited or unavailable in other
            areas. Mobile telephone services outside urban areas are sparse and poor. In rural areas
            of Chaco Paraguayo, there is no cellular phone coverage outside of most Mennonite towns.

            You should only undertake visits to the Chaco wilderness with an experienced guide
            because of the harsh environment and risk of encountering dangerous animals. Staying at
            an estancia (ranch property) is recommended. Because of heavy rainfall and limited
            infrastructure, hiking trips to remote areas should be carefully planned. Ensure you
            have proper equipment and sufficient food and water supplies. A travel itinerary should
            be left with the hotel or with the Consulate of Canada in Asunción.

            Visiting most areas populated by indigenous peoples should present no danger, with the
            exception of the northern area of the Paraguayan Chaco, close to the Mennonite colonies,
            where the Ayoreo woodland group lives. Some Ayoreos may perceive outsiders as a threat.
            Emergency services

            Dial 911 or 441-111 for police.

            Terrorism (see Advisory)

            There are continuing concerns about possible domestic terrorist activity by subversive
            groups, including remnant members of the Shining Path. Isolated incidents have occurred
            in remote areas and cities within the departments of Puno, Piura, Lambayeque, La
            Libertad, Junín, Ayacucho, Cuzco, Ucayali, San Martín, Huánuco, Huancavelica and
            Apurímac. Incidents include robberies, kidnappings, temporary takeovers of small
            villages and, although rare, violence (including bombings) or threats of violence
            against local security forces or community figures. Overland travel in these regions can
            be dangerous.

            Travel in areas where there is coca cultivation and processing is dangerous. You should
            review regional advisories carefully.
            Crime

            Crime is a problem throughout the country. Maintain a high level of vigilance and
            personal security awareness at all times, especially at night. Travel in groups whenever
            possible throughout the country.

            Petty crime is prevalent in Lima and other cities. Purse snatching, pickpocketing, theft
            from vehicles and break-ins occur, even during daylight hours and in crowded public
            areas. Thefts also occur frequently in hotels and restaurants, and while hailing taxis.
            Avoid walking alone in deserted or under-populated areas. Avoid showing signs of
            affluence, wearing jewellery, and carrying unnecessary credit cards and large amounts of
            money. Keep your valuables and identification on your person (in your pocket or in a
            pouch under clothing, for example).

            Attacks and robberies on vehicles occur regularly along the route from the airport in
            Lima. Tourists are often targeted by criminals posing as taxi drivers along this route.
            When arriving at Lima’s Jorge Chávez International Airport, use a secure taxi service to
            go into the city, and exercise particular caution en route to your hotel. Further
            information on registered taxi companies is available on the Lima Airport Partners
            website.

            Theft on intercity and micro buses and at bus terminals is also very common. Ensure that
            your personal belongings, passports and other travel documents are secure at all times.
            Never leave personal belongings unattended. Avoid travelling after dark, when armed
            gangs have been known to stop buses to rob travellers.

            If you are stopped by police or security forces, ask to see official identification.
            Record the officer’s name, badge number and district. Thieves have been known to pose as
            police officers in order to gain the confidence and cooperation of their potential
            victims.

            Thefts on boats by river pirates have been reported along rivers in the Amazon jungle.

            Avoid moneychangers on the street, as they may carry counterfeit currency or work with
            pickpockets. Bystanders have been injured during violent robberies targeting these
            individuals.

            Credit card skimming is also a concern, and travelers should keep their credit cards
            within sight while making transactions.
            Violent crime

            Violent crimes such as carjacking, assault and armed robbery are frequent, especially in
            the cities of Lima, Cuzco and Arequipa.

            While travelling by car, keep your doors locked and windows shut at all times. Keep your
            personal belongings in the trunk of the vehicle as criminals have been known to shatter
            windows (“smash and grab”) or attempt entry at the sight of travel bags or merchandise.
            Criminals have also been known to throw objects in front of oncoming traffic in the
            hopes that cars will stop. If this occurs and you need to stop, do so only in a safe
            location, such as a gas station. Avoid travelling by road outside of major cities after
            dark as there is a high risk of robbery at night.

            Recent incidents of assaults on buses have been reported. Avoid travelling on buses at
            night.

            Incidents of sexual assault including rape have been reported in the cities of Lima,
            Cuzco, Puno, Pucallpa, Arequipa, Chiclayo and Trujillo, and in many isolated areas
            elsewhere in the country. Female travellers should exercise caution at all times,
            especially at bus terminals and in taxis. Never leave food or drinks unattended or in
            the care of strangers. Be wary of accepting snacks, beverages, gum or cigarettes from
            new acquaintances, as they may contain drugs that could put you at risk.

            Remain vigilant due to the threat of “express” kidnappings, in which victims are usually
            abducted for a few hours and forced to withdraw money from automated banking machines
            (ABMs). Most express kidnappings take place at night, but cases also occur during
            daylight hours. Express kidnappings often involve criminals posing as taxi drivers, or
            taxi drivers working for organized gangs. Kidnappers tend to select victims according to
            outward signs of affluence, such as their clothing, vehicle or place of work. Do not
            accept transportation or guide services offered by individuals seeking clients on the
            streets, and book a secure taxi from a reputable company. Resisting a robbery can lead
            to further violence.
            Demonstrations and civil unrest

            Demonstrations, protests and strikes are common throughout the country and may increase
            in the lead-up to, during and after elections. Avoid large crowds, political gatherings
            and marches as they can turn violent without notice. Monitor local media reports for
            up-to-date information and follow the advice of local authorities.

            Strikes and marching demonstrators may cause road blocks which disrupt, public transit
            and travel on roads. Protests in the area of Puno can sometimes result in the closure of
            the border crossing with Bolivia.
            Road travel

            Poor road conditions and a lack of traffic signs are common. Mountainous roads can be
            particularly dangerous, especially at night. When renting a vehicle, always purchase
            insurance. Avoid travelling by road outside of major cities after dark.

            Intercity bus travel can be dangerous. Bus accidents are frequently caused by excessive
            speed, poor vehicle maintenance and driver fatigue. Only use reputable transportation
            companies. Contact your travel agency for a list of recommended intercity bus companies.
            The Peruvian Ministry of Transportation (website in Spanish only) publishes a list of
            the bus companies with the highest rates of traffic accidents resulting in fatalities or
            serious injuries.

            Do not hail taxis on the street. Reserve a taxi by calling a reputable taxi company or
            use taxi services associated with major hotels. Agree to a fare prior to departure, and
            do not pay until you have reached your destination. Having exact fare is recommended as
            taxi drivers sometimes fail to provide change or will continue to drive until they can
            obtain change. Police spot checks are common and can cause delays. Carry identification
            and vehicle registration at all times.
            Air travel

            There have been a number of incidents involving small aircraft in the area of the Nazca
            Lines, some resulting in fatal accidents. Ensure that your airline has a good record and
            appropriate safety measures in place.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            Adventure Travel

            If you intend to trek:

            a) never trek alone;
            b) always hire an experienced guide and ensure that the trekking company is reputable;
            c) buy travel health insurance that includes helicopter rescue and medical evacuation;
            d) ensure that you are in top physical condition;
            e) advise a family member or friend of your itinerary;
            f) register when entering national parks;
            g) know the symptoms of acute altitude sickness, which can be fatal;
            h) register with the Embassy of Canada in Peru; and
            i) obtain detailed information on trekking routes before setting out. Treks and hiking
            excursions should be undertaken in groups, with experienced tour guides only.

            Each year, several hikers and climbers partaking in adventure activities are victims of
            serious accidents in the Andes, some of which are fatal. Climbers should be well
            informed on the possible hazards and exercise extreme caution in steep or slippery
            areas, which are neither fenced nor marked. Exercise extreme caution while climbing the
            Huayna Picchu, a peak near Machu Picchu, where serious injuries and deaths have
            occurred. Assaults have also been reported along the Inca Trail and in the Huaraz region
            of the Cordillera Blanca mountains.

            Contact the Peruvian national police’s High Mountain Rescue Unit (USAM) before visiting
            mountainous areas in Ancash (tel.: 51-1-575-1555, fax: 51-1-575-3036, email:
            ceopol_diravpol@hotmail.com).

            Swimming in jungle lakes and rivers can be dangerous due to the presence of parasites
            and wildlife. Strong currents exist in the Pacific Ocean and in rivers. Seek advice from
            local residents before swimming and consult local authorities about recent conditions.

            There have been several recent accidents and drownings involving tourists white-water
            rafting, particularly on the Urubamba River near Cuzco. Ensure that the rafting company
            follows strict safety guidelines prior to participating in any such activities.

            Recently, spiritual cleansing ceremonies offered by shamans and other individuals have
            led to the serious illness, deaths and assaults of several tourists. These services are
            not regulated and may involve taking substances that can cause medical complications and
            severely impair cognitive and physical abilities.
            Emergency services

            Dial 105 for emergency assistance. For tourist assistance and information, contact iPeru
            (tel.: (01) 574-8000, email: iperu@promperu.gob.pe).

            The Peruvian government has opened tourist police offices in most tourist destinations.
            Tourist police can be contacted at 0800-2221 from anywhere in Peru. The local telephone
            numbers for the tourist police in Lima are 51-1-715-6554 (Miraflores), 51-1-423-3500
            (Lima North) and 51-1-243-2190 (Lima South). Jorge Chávez Airport in Lima has its own
            tourist police office open 24 hours a day to provide service (51-1-517-1841). There are

            Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao and vicinity (see Advisory)

            There is a serious risk of terrorist attacks and kidnappings in this region. Bombs
            causing deaths and injuries have exploded in public areas of major centres, including
            the cities of Cotabato, Cagayan de Oro, Davao, Kidapawan, Zamboanga, General Santos,
            Jolo and Isabela.

            Clashes occur between insurgent groups, and between armed groups and security forces.
            These incidents often result in deaths and property destruction, and innocent bystanders
            have occasionally been taken hostage.

            Several foreigners have been kidnapped in this region. Threats of abduction of, or
            violence toward, foreigners continue to occur.

            If you are visiting or living in this region despite this Advisory, review your security
            situation regularly and take appropriate precautions, particularly when visiting places
            frequented by foreigners.
            Terrorism

            The threat of terrorist activities exists throughout the country, including in major
            cities. Bombings, shootings and kidnappings have occurred on public transportation, at
            airports, in shopping malls and in other public areas. Foreigners and places frequented
            by foreigners have been targeted. Explosive devices continue to be discovered by
            security authorities. Expect to be subject to frequent security checks at public and
            private facilities, including shopping malls and public transportation stations. Be
            vigilant and comply with all security procedures.
            Kidnapping

            Be alert to the danger of kidnap-for-ransom, which can occur throughout the country,
            including in areas frequented by tourists. The threat is particularly high in the
            Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao and surrounding areas (see Advisory). Victims have
            been held for lengthy periods and some have been killed.
            Crime

            The possession of guns or other weapons is common. Violent crime such as armed robbery,
            sexual assault and murder occur, and foreigners are occasionally targeted. Generally,
            targeted violent incidents increase around election periods.

            Petty crime such as pickpocketing and bag snatching also occurs, especially in urban
            areas. Avoid showing signs of affluence and carrying large sums of money, and keep
            valuables in safekeeping facilities. Beware of friendly strangers offering to take you
            around town or on an excursion. Never leave your food or drinks unattended or in the
            care of strangers. Be wary of accepting snacks, beverages, gum or cigarettes from new
            acquaintances, as they may contain drugs that could put you at risk of sexual assault
            and robbery.
            Scams

            Be wary of a variety of scams involving, for example, money counting (exchange), taxi
            meters, online romances and email requests for funds. Credit card and bank card fraud is
            common; pay careful attention when your cards are being handled by others during payment
            processing. Locals with children may befriend single male tourists and then accuse them
            of child abuse in order to extort money from them.

            Before travelling to the Philippines to visit someone with whom you have developed a
            romantic relationship, especially on the Internet, find out about the country’s customs
            and laws on conjugal relations and marriage. Once in the country, ensure that you hold
            onto your return plane ticket, money and passport.

            Report any incident of crime or scams to local police in the jurisdiction where the
            incident occurred, before you leave the country. See Overseas fraud for more information
            on scams abroad.
            Demonstrations

            Avoid protests, demonstrations, political rallies and large gatherings, as they may turn
            violent without notice. See Laws and culture for more information.
            Transportation

            Avoid travel outside urban areas and tourist centres after dark.

            Driving conditions are poor: roads are crowded and many drivers do not follow safe
            driving practices. Stay on national highways and paved roads.

            Commercial taxis are the most-used form of public transportation by foreigners within
            cities. Never share taxis with strangers. Incidents of taxi drivers using threats to
            extort money from passengers have been reported. Arrange to be met at airports, use
            hotel transportation or use official metered airport taxis.

            Exercise caution if using public transportation, including jeepneys, buses and the light
            rail system, as pick pocketing and armed robberies are frequent. Provincial buses are
            often overcrowded and poorly maintained, and have been involved in a number of fatal
            accidents.

            Several passenger boats, including ferries, have sunk due to overloading and poor
            maintenance. Often, there are more passengers than life jackets. Do not board vessels
            that appear overloaded or unseaworthy.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            Piracy

            Pirate attacks occur in coastal waters and, in some cases, farther out at sea. Mariners
            should take appropriate precautions. For additional information, consult the Live Piracy
            Report published by the International Maritime Bureau.
            Scuba diving

            Diving schools and rescue services may not adhere to Canadian standards. Use only
            reputable dive companies. Verify with your dive company where the closest decompression
            chamber is located.
            Emergency services

            Dial 117.

            Crime

            The rate of violent crime in Poland is generally low. Petty crime (pickpocketing, purse
            snatching) occur, particularly in larger cities. Organized groups of thieves operate at
            major tourist destinations, on public transportation, at train stations, near hotels and
            in busy markets. Thieves also target the bus and tram route to and from Warsaw Frederic
            Chopin Airport.

            Exercise caution on trains, particularly at night. Store personal belongings in a safe
            place, do not leave the compartment unattended and ensure the door is secured from the
            inside. Most pickpocketing on trains occurs during boarding. Commonly, a group of
            well-dressed young men will jostle and rob a passenger as they supposedly attempt to get
            around the victim in a narrow aisle of the train.

            Youth gangs can be a threat, particularly in urban areas. There have been reports of
            individuals being harassed for reasons of race, sexual orientation or foreign looking
            appearance.
            Road safety

            Poland has been improving its highway system, but travel by road can be hazardous
            outside of major centres. Most roads are poorly maintained, narrow and badly lit, and
            traffic is congested. Some drivers have little regard for traffic regulations and do not
            follow safe driving practices.

            The country\'s role as a major east-west route for transport trucks also poses risks.
            Horse-drawn and slow-moving agricultural vehicles are common in rural areas. Avoid
            driving long distances at night.
            Public transportation

            Use only officially marked taxis. Make sure that the taxi meter is in use, as all
            registered taxis are required to have an operating meter. The taxi should display the
            rate per kilometre on the back passenger window, visible from outside the vehicle. Be
            wary of taxi drivers who approach you at the airport or whose vehicles do not display
            telephone numbers and a company name; these drivers usually charge exorbitant rates.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            Spiked food and drinks

            Never leave food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers. Be wary of accepting
            snacks, beverages, gum or cigarettes from new acquaintances, as they may contain drugs
            that could put you at risk of sexual assault and robbery.
            General safety measures

            Exercise normal safety precautions. Ensure that your personal belongings, passports and
            other travel documents are secure at all times.

            You must report the loss or theft of your passport to the local police. A police report
            is required for the issuance of a new passport or the replacement of a Polish visa.
            Emergency services

            Mobile phone users can dial 112 for emergency assistance and roadside assistance. Dial
            997 to reach police, 999 to reach ambulance and 998 to reach fire fighters.

            Petty crime

            Violent crimes toward tourists are rare in Portugal. Non-violent petty crimes, such as
            pickpocketing and bag snatching, however, are on the rise. The petty thieves are very
            skilled, and often work in groups. Be vigilant in public areas, all tourist attractions,
            beaches, restaurants, hotel lobbies, bus stations, train stations and airports.

            In Lisbon, exercise caution at all train and underground stations, and particularly on
            electric trams numbered E28, to Castelo de São Jorge; E25, to Prazeres; and E15, to
            Belém.

            Exercise caution when travelling to Queluz and Sintra, to visit the castles and palaces,
            as well as to the Costa da Caparica beach, south of Lisbon. If visiting the Estoril
            coast and the village of Cascais, be especially careful at Guincho Beach, Cabo da Roca
            and Boca do Inferno (Mouth of Hell).

            In Porto, do not walk alone after dark, especially along the waterfront of the Douro
            River.

            Do not let your guard down outside of the main cities, as thieves may be watching and
            can strike anywhere. Be especially careful in the Algarve region in such towns as Lagos
            and Albufeira, as well as in small coastal towns along and up to the north side of the
            country, such as Aljezur, Nazaré, Ericeira and Peniche, where petty crimes have been
            reported.

            If you are robbed, go to the nearest police station to report the crime and obtain a
            police report. There are tourist police stations in Lisbon, Porto, Portimão and Cascais.
            Spiked food and drinks

            Never leave your drinks unattended or in the care of strangers. Be wary of accepting
            snacks, beverages, gum or cigarettes from new acquaintances. Drugs may be present that
            could put you at risk of sexual assault and robbery.
            Road travel

            Rental cars and vehicles with foreign licence plates are frequently targeted for
            break-ins. Avoid leaving personal items and documents (especially passports) in plain
            sight in a vehicle.

            If you experience car trouble, stop at a gas station or rest stop, if possible. If you
            must stop unexpectedly, be aware of your immediate surroundings and keep a careful watch
            on bystanders, including those who offer to help.

            Be suspicious of anyone signalling you to stop on roads or highways. Thieves have been
            known to use this tactic to steal valuables, unattended bags and even the vehicle.

            Incidents of thieves on motorcycles slashing rental car tires when the car is stopped at
            an intersection have been reported. This forces the vehicle to stop on the side of the
            road and allows for the thieves to approach and distract the passengers by offering
            assistance, while another steals belongings that are within reach. If this occurs, when
            possible, lock your doors and call your rental car agency or emergency services from
            within the car. Avoid opening your window, unlocking the car or stepping out of the
            vehicle. Official assistance and road monitoring vehicles are present on Portuguese
            highways and will come to your assistance. When possible, wait for the police to arrive.

            Do not open the trunk before you finish parking when you arrive at your destination;
            this prevents thieves from knowing what is hidden in the trunk.

            Whenever possible, use secure parking facilities, especially overnight. Do not leave
            your vehicle unattended and ensure that windows are closed and doors are locked at all
            times.

            Excessive speeds, unpredictable driving habits and reckless motorcyclists create
            hazards. Be aware that slow-moving machinery may be found travelling on rural and
            national roads.
            Public transportation

            Local and inter-city train and bus services are good.

            Taxis are widely available. Confirm the fare prior to getting into the taxi or ensure
            that the meter is used.

            A tourism information kiosk in the arrivals area of the Lisbon airport offers a wide
            range of tourism information, including expected taxi fares, and sells taxi vouchers at
            standardized prices for many locations in the city and metro area. Use a taxi from the
            queue or kiosk and do not accept rides from someone who approaches you.

            A ferry runs between the islands of Madeira and Porto Santo.

            Daily domestic flights link the mainland to the islands of the Azores, as well as to
            Madeira.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            Demonstrations

            Demonstrations occur frequently in larger urban centres and have the potential to
            suddenly turn violent. They can lead to significant disruptions to traffic and public
            transportation. Avoid all demonstrations, follow the advice of local authorities and
            monitor local media.
            Beaches and water activities

            While beaches are generally considered safe, do not leave your personal belongings
            unattended.

            During the summer months, deaths by drowning have occurred on beaches and in swimming
            pools. Take warning flags on beaches seriously. The Portuguese Maritime Police have the
            authority to fine bathers who disobey the lifeguard’s warning flags. Don’t swim at
            beaches that link to/from rivers, as the water currents can be very strong. Don’t dive
            into unknown water as hidden rocks or shallow depths can cause serious injury or death.

            In the fall and winter months, be cautious when walking along beaches close to the
            water’s edge because waves can be very unpredictable in size and may come onto shore
            further than expected and with strong undertows. Do not visit beaches or coastal areas
            during periods of severe weather warnings. Exercise caution and follow the advice of the
            local authorities.

            Look out for signs warning of cliff erosion. Falling rocks are a hazard and authorities
            can fine those who ignore warning signs.

            In marine areas, coral, jellyfish and other ocean life found along reefs can poison,
            sting or cause infection if touched or stepped on. Ask local authorities about the
            presence of such species and whether they are dangerous.
            General safety information

            You must carry identification at all times. Keep a photocopy of your passport in case of
            loss or seizure.

            Exercise normal safety precautions. Ensure that your personal belongings and passport
            and other travel documents are secure at all times. Pay attention to your surroundings,
            avoid showing signs of affluence and do not carry large sums of cash. If possible, carry
            only the documents, cash and belongings you will need for the day, and leave all other
            items in a hotel safe.
            Emergency services

            The decision to travel is your responsibility. You are also responsible for your
            personal safety abroad. The purpose of this Travel Advice is to provide up-to-date
            information to enable you to make well-informed decisions.

            Canadians rarely encounter safety and security problems, but normal safety precautions
            should be taken due to an increase in violent crime. Petty crime and robberies are
            prevalent. Ensure that your personal belongings are secure at all times.

            Terrorism

            There is a constant terrorist threat throughout the Arabian Peninsula, where reports of
            planned terrorist attacks occasionally emerge. Maintain a high level of vigilance and
            personal security awareness at all times. Exercise caution in areas known to be
            frequented by foreigners (commercial, public and tourist areas), monitor local
            developments and follow the advice of local authorities. Register with and carefully
            follow messages issued through the Registration of Canadians Abroad service.

            On September 21, 2014, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) released a
            statement threatening retaliation for the American-led coalition campaign against ISIL
            in Iraq and Syria. The statement encouraged opportunistic and indiscriminate attacks
            against citizens and interests of countries supporting the coalition, which includes
            Canada. Individuals and terrorist groups in the region may be inspired to carry out
            attacks in a show of solidarity with ISIL. Exercise a high degree of personal security
            awareness at all times, maintain a heightened level of vigilance and be aware of your
            surroundings.
            Crime

            The crime rate is low and violence is rare. Petty crime could occur, including banking
            and credit card fraud. Ensure that personal belongings and passports and other travel
            documents are secure at all times.
            Women’s safety

            Although it is rare, there have been reports of physical and verbal harassment toward
            women. Women should not travel alone, especially after dark. Consult our publication
            entitled Her Own Way: A Woman’s Safe-Travel Guide for travel safety information
            specifically aimed at Canadian women.
            Road travel

            Exercise increased caution when travelling by car, due to recent attacks against
            foreigners in the region.

            Accidents are common. Unsafe driving practices, including use of excessive speed, and
            poor lighting create hazards.

            Off-road driving can be hazardous and should only be undertaken in a convoy of
            four-wheel-drive vehicles with an experienced guide. Leave a travel itinerary with a
            relative or friend. Be well prepared and equipped with gasoline, water, food and a cell
            phone.

            In case of accidents without injury, move the vehicle to the nearest parking area (or
            you may receive a fine for blocking traffic), call 999 and wait for the police to
            arrive. If the accident caused injuries or deaths, do not move the vehicle, call 999 and
            wait for the police to arrive. The driver must not leave until permitted by the police
            to do so, as leaving the scene is considered a criminal offence.

            Use only officially marked taxis or reputable limousine services, and avoid shared
            taxis.
            Air travel

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            Sea travel

            Pirate attacks occur in coastal waters and, in some cases, farther out at sea. Mariners
            should take appropriate precautions. For additional information, consult the Live Piracy
            Report published by the International Maritime Bureau.

            Exercise caution if travelling by sea, including for recreational purposes, in the
            Persian Gulf, particularly around the islands of Abu Masa and the Tunbs. Iran and the
            United Arab Emirates both claim sovereignty over these islands.
            General safety information

            Carry identification documents at all times. Leave your passport in a safe place and
            carry a photocopy for identification purposes. Make copies of your visa or residence
            permit and keep it in a safe place.
            Emergency services

            Dial 999 in case of an emergency.

        <item>
            Crime

            Criminal activity occurs as a result of long-term economic recession and the influx of
            arms. Street crime such as mugging and purse snatching can occur. Local police resources
            are limited and response to emergency calls is often very slow (15 minutes or more). In
            case of robbery, legal recourse is limited. Ensure that personal belongings and travel
            documents are secure at all times. Do not show signs of affluence, and do not venture
            out alone after dark.

            Poorly marked roadblocks monitored by undisciplined, armed soldiers are present
            throughout the country. Security forces may detain foreigners and/or attempt extortion.
            Civil unrest

            Even though a ceasefire accord was signed in March 2003 between the Congolese government
            and the Ninja rebel group, war-related crimes, such as the murder of Congolese civilians
            or looting of private property, remain a risk, particularly in the Pool region. You
            should exercise caution and should be especially vigilant and avoid situations where
            political violence and demonstrations may occur.
            Road travel

            Other than National Route 2, north of Brazzaville, which reaches the city of Oyo, most
            roads are dirt tracks. Overland travel outside major cities should only be undertaken
            during daylight hours, in a convoy of four-wheel-drive vehicles. You should provide your
            itinerary to the Embassy of Canada in Kinshasa. Although no authorization is required
            for road travel in the Pool region, you can take the precaution of requesting

            United Nations offices in Kinshasa (Democratic Republic of the Congo).
            Rail travel

            Passenger travel on the railroad is discouraged, as there are frequent reports of
            extortion by undisciplined security forces and robberies by criminal elements along the
            route. The rail line between Pointe-Noire and Brazzaville should be avoided as it is not
            safe and is frequently attacked by rebels. The rail service is very sporadic at best and
            several serious accidents in recent years have raised concerned over safety standards.
            Air travel

            Travel between Brazzaville and Pointe-Noire should be by air. Note that while flights
            between Brazzaville and the cities of Pointe-Noire, Nkayi and Loubomo run on a daily
            basis, the air links to other cities like Impfondo may be more random. Departure
            schedules are often not respected.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            General safety information

            Tourist facilities are limited. There are frequent electrical power outages and fuel
            shortages.

            Demonstrations

            Demonstrations occur and have the potential to suddenly turn violent. They can lead to
            significant disruptions to traffic and public transportation. Avoid all demonstrations
            and large gatherings, follow the advice of local authorities and monitor local media.
            Crime

            The rate of violent crime is low. Pickpocketing, purse snatching and mugging occur,
            especially in Bucharest and other urban centres. Be vigilant in crowded areas such as
            busy streets, buses, subways, trains, train stations and airport terminals. Avoid
            walking alone after dark.

            Organized groups of thieves, which may include children, operate particularly in public
            transport centres, such as train stations, subways and buses.

            Theft can occur on intercity trains. Do not leave your compartment unattended, and
            ensure that the door is secured from the inside.
            Road travel

            Driving can be hazardous due to aggressive drivers, erratic driving behaviour and high
            speeds. Other than major city streets and intercity highways, many roads are in
            disrepair, poorly lit, narrow and without marked lanes. Do not drive after dark outside
            of major cities because of the unsafe conditions, which also include the presence of
            horse-drawn carts without lights and wandering livestock.
            Public transportation

            Taxis are readily available and are an affordable mode of transportation. Use only
            licensed metered taxis that display their price lists. Verify the tariffs on the taxi’s
            window before boarding and ensure that the meter displays the correct tariff. Tariffs
            are cheaper during the day and more expensive when travelling outside of the city
            limits. Visit the taxis booth within the arrivals terminal of the Bucharest airport to
            obtain a fair rate. Do not hail a taxi on the street; instead, order one from your
            hotel. Avoid travelling alone in a taxi to remote areas.

            Rail services are generally poor by Western standards. It is, therefore, preferable to
            travel by inter-city buses, which are frequent, comfortable and relatively fast.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            Fraud/scams

            Credit card and automated banking machine (ABM) card fraud occurs. Pay careful attention
            when cards are being handled by others during payment processing. It is preferable to
            use ABMs located inside financial institutions or large hotels, rather than those on the
            street.

            See our Overseas fraud page for more information on scams abroad.
            Spiked food and drinks

            Never leave food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers. Be wary of accepting
            snacks, beverages, gum or cigarettes from new acquaintances, as the items may contain
            drugs that could put you at risk of sexual assault and robbery.
            General safety information

            Carry adequate identification at all times. A photocopy of your passport is acceptable,
            and will help in case of loss or seizure of the original document.

            Exercise normal safety precautions. Ensure that your personal belongings and passport
            and other travel documents are secure at all times, especially on public transportation.
            Avoid showing signs of affluence and carrying large sums of cash.
            Emergency services

            Dial 112 for emergency assistance.

            Rostov Oblast

            The Russian government has declared a state of emergency in Rostov Oblast, where it
            maintains a significant military presence. The situation along the Ukrainian border is
            unpredictable and could evolve quickly. Exercise extreme vigilance if you must travel to
            this region, as armed clashes and violence pose serious threats to your security. If you
            are currently in this area, you should strongly consider leaving. The ability of the
            Embassy of Canada in Moscow to provide consular assistance in these districts is
            extremely limited.
            Republics of Chechnya, Ingushetia and Dagestan (see Advisory)

            Despite the end of the Chechen War in 2009, there remains an insurgency in the North
            Caucasus, during which terrorist attacks are frequent. The security situation is
            unstable and dangerous. Suicide bombings occur on a regular basis and targeted
            assassinations have also taken place. Unexploded mines and munitions are widespread.
            Kidnapping for ransom is also common.

            You must obtain special permission from the Ministry of the Interior to enter certain
            areas of the country.
            Republics of Karachai-Cherkessia, Kabardino-Balkaria (including the Mount Elbrus region)
            and North Ossetia (see Advisory)

            Tensions remain high in the border regions with Georgia since the 2008 conflict in South
            Ossetia, and may affect the security situation in the republics of Karachai-Cherkessia,
            Kabardino-Balkaria and North Ossetia. Military operations are carried out with little or
            no notice, and are accompanied by travel restrictions. The border crossings to Georgia
            and Azerbaijan are subject to frequent, sometimes lengthy closures.
            Terrorism

            Terrorist incidents have occurred most frequently in the North Caucasus and in Moscow,
            but may happen throughout Russia. Exercise caution in public places, particularly on
            public transport (including subways, railways, airports and buses), and during large
            gatherings and events.

            On December 29, 2013, an explosive device was detonated inside the main railway station
            of the city of Volgograd; on December 30, another explosive device was detonated on a
            public bus in the same city. These incidents caused deaths and injuries. Security
            measures have been reinforced throughout Russia, specifically in the Volgograd region.
            The Domodedovo International Airport and the Moscow subway system have also been
            targeted by terrorist attacks

            Remain vigilant, monitor local news reports and follow the advice of local authorities.
            Authorities perform random identity checks frequently in public places.
            Crime

            Crime against foreigners is a serious problem. Harassment and attacks are prevalent,
            especially for foreigners of Asian and African descent. Some victims have died.
            Foreigners in the areas to which we advise against all travel (see above) are
            particularly vulnerable. Several journalists and local aid personnel have been killed or
            kidnapped. Criminals have targeted and destroyed well-marked aid convoys

            Exercise extreme caution in crowds and places frequented by skinhead groups, including
            open markets.

            Violent crime is common. Pickpocketing, assaults and robberies occur frequently and are
            often committed by groups of children and teenagers. Criminals employ various techniques
            to distract the victims, including luring people to help them. In such situations, walk
            away quickly. Underground walkways, public transport, tourist sites, restaurants,
            transport hubs, markets, and hotel rooms and residences (even when occupied and locked
            are preferred targets. Reduce your risk of being targeted by travelling in groups with
            reputable tour agencies.

            Criminals may also pose as police officers, particularly in St. Petersburg. Real police
            officers wear a visible personal identification number on their uniforms. Avoid showing
            signs of affluence and ensure personal belongings, passports and other travel documents
            are secure at all times. Replacing travel documents and visas is difficult, and could
            considerably delay your return to Canada.

            Cases of drugging followed by robbery and assault have been reported. Do not accept food
            and drinks from strangers, and do not leave food and drinks unattended in bars,
            nightclubs or restaurants. Order only bottled drinks in order to minimize risk.

            Bogus checkpoints may be set up in rural areas in order to commit robbery.

            Traffic police may stop motorists to collect fraudulent cash fines on the spot.

            Credit card and automated banking machine (ABM) fraud occurs. Pay careful attention when
            your cards are being handled by others during payment processing.
            Organized crime

            Organized criminal groups remain active throughout Russia, especially in large cities.
            Credit card fraud is one type of activity. Extortion and corruption are common business
            practices, including among foreign businesses. Criminals demand protection money under
            threat of serious violence. Report extortion attempts to Russian authorities
            Demonstrations

            Rallies, protests and demonstrations occur in Russia. They can lead to significant
            disruptions in traffic and public transportation. Avoid all demonstrations and large
            gatherings, follow the advice of local authorities and monitor local media.
            Transportation

            Use only registered taxis and do not share a taxi with strangers. Negotiate the price
            before getting into a taxi.

            Road conditions vary and are often poor outside major cities. Traffic regulations are
            mostly ignored. Road accidents are common and pedestrians should be particularly
            careful. In the event of an accident, do not move the vehicle until the police arrive,
            even if the car is obstructing traffic. Drive only during daylight hours.

            When travelling by train, store valuables in a safe place and do not leave the
            compartment unattended. Lock the door from the inside.

            Boat accidents are common due to the overloading and poor maintenance of some vessels.
            Safety standards differ from those in Canada. Exercise caution and common sense when
            using marine transportation. Do not board vessels that appear overloaded or unseaworthy.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            Fraud

            Fraud has been reported by victims developing friendships or romantic relationships over
            the Internet and becoming entangled in financial issues. Remain vigilant and be aware
            that neither the Embassy of Canada in Moscow or Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development
            Canada can help you recover lost funds or property in such cases.

            See our Overseas Fraud page for more information on scams abroad.
            General safety information

            Power outages and shortages occur often throughout Russia.

            Regions bordering the DRC

            Be extremely vigilant in the areas along the border with the Democratic Republic of
            Congo (DRC). There are several active armed rebel groups in eastern DRC, and the
            security situation can deteriorate very suddenly. Incursions into Rwanda by these groups
            have occurred, and artillery fire landed on Rwandan territory in 2013. The Rwanda-DRC
            border can be closed without notice.
            Crime

            The level of crime is relatively low in Rwanda. However, petty theft from cars and hotel
            rooms occurs, and pickpockets are active in crowded places. House break-ins have
            occurred in Kigali. Remain alert to your surroundings and ensure that your personal
            belongings and vehicles are secure. Do not show signs of affluence and do not venture
            out alone or travel outside major cities after dark.
            Demonstrations

            Demonstrations occur and have the potential to suddenly turn violent. They can lead to
            significant disruptions to traffic and public transportation. Avoid all demonstrations
            and large gatherings, follow the advice of local authorities and monitor local media.
            Road travel

            In general, the main roads in Kigali and linking Kigali to other cities are relatively
            well maintained; however, dirt roads, particularly the Gisenyi-Kibuye-Cyangugu road, are
            in poor condition. Excessive speed, careless driving, the lack of basic safety equipment
            on many vehicles, the presence of pedestrians, cyclists and livestock on the roads, and
            the lack of streetlights pose hazards. Some roads may be difficult or impossible to
            access during the rainy season. Avoid travel after dark, particularly in rural areas.
            Police checkpoints are frequent.

            The use of a mobile telephone while driving is illegal, unless it is fitted with a
            hands-free device.

            Third-party insurance is required to cover damages if you are involved in an accident
            resulting in injuries even if you are not found to be at fault. If you are suspected of
            causing an accident, your driver’s licence can be confiscated during the investigation.
            If the accident results in death, you may be subject to a jail sentence.
            Public transportation

            Shared taxis (minivans), the most common form of public transportation, can be dangerous
            due to overloading and reckless driving. Use licensed auto taxis, which are
            orange-striped. Confirm the fare with the driver before departing.

            Be cautious when using motorbike taxis, as they are unsafe. Do not use them at night.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            Adventure tourism

            No recent incidents have been reported at the Parc National des Volcans and the Nyungwe
            Forest National Park. Park permits must be purchased from Rwanda’s Office of Tourism and
            National Parks. Within the parks, be accompanied by an official guide and only use
            established trails.
            General safety information

            Tourist facilities are adequate in Kigali and other major towns, but are limited in
            remote areas. In remote areas, access to electricity is limited. During the dry season,
            there may be water shortages in some areas of the country and in some parts of Kigali.
            Emergency services

            Dial 912 for ambulance services; note that they are insufficiently equipped. Dial 112
            for police. Police officers, especially those on the street, may not speak English or
            French.

            In the event of a traffic accident: in Kigali, dial 113 for police; elsewhere, go
            directly to the nearest police station.

            Petty crime occurs and increases with the approach of annual festivities, such as the
            jazz festival in May, carnival celebrations in July and during the winter holiday
            season. Muggings have occurred in areas frequented by tourists. Avoid showing signs of
            affluence, carry minimal sums of money and leave your passport and other valuables in
            your hotel safe.

            Avoid unpopulated areas and unpatrolled beaches, especially after dark, and avoid
            staying in hotels or villas in isolated areas, which may have inadequate security. Check
            with local authorities to determine which beaches are safe.

            Avoid the districts of Marchand, Broglie, St. Grass, St. Leslie Land, and Wilton Yard,
            located off of Chausee Road which have high rates of crime.

            marked areas. Avoid deserted and unpatrolled beaches after dark.

            Always hire an experienced guide for mountain expeditions to the northern part of Saint
            Vincent and ensure that the trekking company is reputable, as there is limited police
            presence in the area(notably in Trinity Falls, Falls of Baleine, and Soufrière).

            Road travel

            Streets in São Tomé are paved but there are many large potholes. Roads outside the
            capital are paved and in fair condition, but they are poorly lit and can be impassable
            during the rainy season. Roaming animals pose a hazard. Car rentals, with or without
            drivers, can be arranged through major hotels. Honking to warn of your approach is
            considered a normal practice. Emergency roadside services are non-existent.
            Public transportation

            Other than taxis, there is no public transportation. Taxi fares should be negotiated
            prior to departure.

            There is air transportation between São Tomé and Príncipe islands but seats must be
            reserved in advance.

            Piracy

            Pirate attacks occur in coastal waters and, in some cases, farther out at sea. Mariners

            Terrorism

            There is a terrorist threat throughout Saudi Arabia, and attacks may occur throughout
            the country. Although groups commonly target government buildings, public areas, areas
            frequented by tourists and Western interests, Westerners may be directly targeted.
            Sectarian attacks may also occur throughout the country. Heightened security measures
            are currently in place and may be reinforced on short notice.

            On September 21, 2014, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) released a
            statement threatening retaliation for the American -led coalition campaign against ISIL
            in Iraq and Syria. The statement encouraged opportunistic and indiscriminate attacks
            against citizens and interests of countries supporting the coalition, which includes
            Canada. Individuals and terrorist groups in the region may be inspired to carry out
            attacks in a show of solidarity with ISIL. Exercise a high degree of personal security
            awareness at all times, maintain a heightened level of vigilance and be aware of your
            surroundings.

            Maintain a high level of vigilance and personal security awareness at all times.
            Register with and carefully follow messages issued through the Registration of Canadians

            Southwestern border area with Yemen

            Exercise extreme caution if you are travelling to or within southwestern Saudi Arabia,
            particularly near the Yemeni border. Saudi Arabia has launched airstrikes into Yemen,
            and retaliation by armed groups in Yemen cannot be ruled out. Airports in the area may
            be closed with little or no notice. Verify your travel plans before leaving for the
            airport.
            Kidnapping

            There is a general threat of kidnapping in Saudi Arabia. Maintain a high level of
            vigilance at all times.
            Demonstrations

            Demonstrations, although illegal in Saudi Arabia, have been occurring more frequently
            since 2011 and have the potential to suddenly turn violent. They can also lead to
            significant disruptions to traffic and public transportation. Avoid all demonstrations
            and large gatherings, follow the advice of local authorities and monitor local media.
            Crime

            The crime rate is low. Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, occurs,
            especially in crowded areas and at holy sites. To reduce the likelihood of becoming a
            victim, do not show signs of affluence and ensure that your personal belongings and
            passports and other travel documents are secure at all times.
            Women’s safety

            Assaults against foreign women have occurred recently. Consult our publication entitled
            Her Own Way: A Woman’s Safe-Travel Guide for travel safety information for Canadian
            women.

            Consult Laws and Culture for more information.
            Road travel

            Saudi Arabia is one of the most dangerous places to drive because of poor driving
            habits, a complete disregard for traffic laws and road markings, and excessive
            speed—which are all common causes of accidents. Only use pre-arranged, licensed taxis.
            Avoid shared or service taxis.

            If you are involved in an accident, do not disturb the scene until the traffic patrol
            arrives, do not make any financial arrangement with the other drivers and immediately
            contact your visa sponsor and the Canadian Embassy in Riyadh or the Consulate of Canada
            in Jeddah. In a traffic accident resulting in personal injury, regardless of fault,
            drivers may be held for several days until responsibility is determined and restitution
            is made. If severe injuries or death occur, compensation must be paid to the family for
            the injuries or loss of life.

            Some Saudi cities have implemented an automated traffic ticketing system. All fines
            issued through this system must be paid before leaving the country. Payment can be made
            at the airport during regular Saudi office hours.

            Do not drive off-road unless you are in a convoy of four-wheel-drive vehicles and with
            an experienced guide. Ensure you are well prepared with a sufficient supply of gasoline,
            water and food, and a cell phone. Leave your travel itinerary with a relative or friend.
            Sea travel

            Exercise caution if travelling by sea, including for recreational purposes, in the
            Persian Gulf, particularly around the disputed islands of Abu Musa and Tunbs. Iran and
            the United Arab Emirates each claim sovereignty over the islands.

            Pirate attacks occur in coastal waters and, in some cases, farther out at sea. Mariners
            should take appropriate precautions. For additional information, consult the Live Piracy
            Report published by the International Chamber of Commerce.
            Air travel

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            General safety information

            Carry identification documents, including your residency permit (iqama), at all times.
            Leave your passport in a safe place and carry a photocopy for identification purposes.

            If you are stopped by the Mutawa (Commission for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention
            of Vice); consult the Laws and Culture tab for more information), offer to accompany
            them to the nearest police station and do not hand over identification documents. Inform
            your sponsors if the police retain your documents.
            Emergency services

            Dial 999 for police, 998 for firefighters and 997 for an ambulance.

            Casamance (see Advisory)

            The current security situation in the Casamance region is highly unstable due to the
            threat of armed attacks and highway robbery. The situation is exacerbated by the
            persistent risk of clashes between Senegalese forces and rebels of the MFDC (Mouvement
            des Forces Démocratiques de Casamance). Anti-personnel mines remain a danger in
            Basse-Casamance, where incidents are regularly reported. South of Ziguinchor, near the
            border with Guinea-Bissau, demining zones have been identified and demining operations
            are under way. The entire region remains affected by incidents involving presumed
            separatist groups and armed gangs.

            In general, travel on all roads in the region west of the city of Kolda is not
            recommended, with the exception of the road between Ziguinchor and Cap Skirring. Travel
            to the north around the Gambian border and to the south around the Guinea-Bissau border
            is very dangerous and is not recommended. DFAIT advises maintaining a high level of
            vigilance and personal security awareness when travelling by road east of Kolda. Any
            overland travel within or to these exceptional areas should be undertaken strictly on
            main roads during daylight hours only, ideally in convoy and with reputable carriers or
            tour operators.
            Guinean border area

            Exercise caution in the Guinean border area as the Senegalese authorities may at any
            time implement stricter controls in this area, including roadblocks at which travellers
            will be required to identify themselves.
            Border areas with The Gambia and Guinea-Bissau

            Roads near the border with The Gambia are not safe. Armed attacks on travellers have
            been reported recently, including in the Sedoba region. There is also tension near the
            border with Guinea-Bissau, in the areas of Ziguinchor, Nyassia and Niagha.
            Increased threat of attacks and kidnappings

            In 2013, the French military assisted the Malian government in efforts to repel armed
            rebels. Terrorist groups in the region declared their intention to increase attacks and
            kidnappings targeting Westerners. While the United Nations peacekeeping mission in Mali
            has been supporting the transitional authorities in stabilizing the region since July
            2013, citizens of countries supporting the intervention are still at particular risk,
            but all travellers should exercise increased vigilance in the region.
            Crime

            Violent robberies may occur in the main cities, particularly Dakar. Remain vigilant when
            travelling, protect travel documents, avoid displays of affluence, and stay away from
            isolated places, particularly at night.

            Exercise caution in the arrivals and departures areas at the airport, especially after
            dark. These areas are often crowded, and travellers are regularly approached or get
            rushed by strangers. Many hotels offer a free shuttle service. Ensure that you confirm
            the identity of the person welcoming you at the airport to confirm that he or she was
            sent by the hotel.

            The Gorée pier is a favourite spot for pickpockets. Avoid displaying valuable items on
            your person. Keep your bags close to you, remain vigilant and do not stop to talk with
            people who call out to you.

            In Dakar, armed robberies are becoming more frequent in homes, on the Corniche road and
            at the beach. In general, assaults take place early in the morning and after dusk. Avoid
            walking on the Corniche road in the evening, especially on the eastern and western
            Corniche, between the Olympic Club and the Mosque of the Divinity. Also avoid strolling
            along the beach at the end of the day.
            Demonstrations and strikes

            Country-wide strikes and demonstrations are common and can suddenly turn violent. Avoid
            large public gatherings and demonstrations. Stay away from places where these could
            occur and follow the advice of local authorities at all times. Monitor the local media
            and other sources of information to keep abreast of any security threats,
            demonstrations, public gatherings or labour strikes.
            Checkpoints

            You are advised always to carry photo identification, as well as a certified copy of
            your passport. The authorities may conduct checks at any time.
            Transportation

            Main roads are in good condition, but travel after dark can be difficult because of poor
            lighting. Most secondary roads require a four-wheel-drive vehicle, particularly in the
            rainy season.

            The presence of pedestrians and animals, combined with bad driving habits and poorly
            maintained vehicles, makes local driving conditions difficult.

            It is advisable to report a road accident as soon as possible to the nearest police
            station, in order to avoid any conflict between the parties involved. In the event of
            personal injury or death, drivers are detained until a judge determines responsibility.
            If you are driving a rental car, both you and the rental company will be held
            responsible.

            Avoid using public transportation if the vehicle appears overcrowded or poorly
            maintained.

            Taxis are often badly driven and can be poorly maintained. Use regulated taxis only, and
            agree on the fare beforehand.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            Fraud

            Cases of attempted fraud are frequently reported in Senegal. See our Overseas Fraud page
            for more information on scams abroad.
            General safety information

            Use only reputable and professional guides or tour operators, and choose
            well-established accommodations. Visits to wildlife parks should also be arranged only
            through reputable tour operators. Ensure that you always follow park rules.

            Areas bordering Kosovo

            You should exercise a high degree of caution in the areas bordering Kosovo due to the
            potential for political tensions and possible unrest.
            Crime

            The incidence of street crime is similar to that elsewhere in Europe, particularly in
            urban centres. Pickpocketing occurs at airports, on public transportation and in other
            public places. Foreigners could be targeted by thieves. Car thieves target
            four-wheel-drive and luxury vehicles more than other models.

            Use common sense in determining the need to drive with car windows closed and doors
            locked.
            Demonstrations

            Demonstrations and roadblocks occur and have the potential to suddenly turn violent,
            especially in the vicinity of official buildings and foreign embassies. Avoid all
            demonstrations, large gatherings and roadblocks, follow the advice of local authorities
            and monitor local and international media.
            Landmines

            Special care should be taken in the areas that border Kosovo. Stay on the main roads as
            unexploded landmines and other unexploded ordnance remain in Serbia, particularly in the
            Presevo and Bujanovac districts (in southern Serbia).
            Road travel

            Secondary roads are often narrow and poorly maintained. The Ibarska Magistrala road is
            dangerous due to poor road conditions and traffic congestion. Expect delays along major
            or minor routes due to road construction.

            There have been incidents where police have targeted vehicles with foreign plates, often
            demanding immediate cash payment for alleged traffic violations. If stopped, request a
            full explanation and, if an explanation is not forthcoming, request permission to speak
            to the Embassy of Canada in Belgrade.
            Public transportation

            Public transportation is often old and overcrowded, especially in Belgrade. Use only
            officially marked taxis and pre-negotiate fares where meter is not in use. Make use of
            the taxi reservation service in the baggage claim area of Belgrade’s Nikola Tesla
            airport in order to avoid being charged exorbitant rates for transportation to the city
            centre.

            Railway equipment is old. Trains are slow and often subject to delays. A number of
            companies offer domestic and international bus services. The larger firms have modern,
            well-maintained fleets.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            Fraud

            Credit card fraud is common. See our Overseas Fraud page for more information on scams
            abroad.
            General safety information

            Exercise a high degree of caution in all places. Ensure that your personal belongings,
            passports and other travel documents are secure at all times, particularly on public
            transportation and in large crowds or public markets. Avoid showing signs of affluence
            and carrying large sums of cash.
            Emergency services

            Dial 192 for the police, 193 for firefighters, 194 for ambulance and 1987 for roadside
            assistance.

            Crime

            Petty crime such as muggings, purse snatching and pickpocketing are increasing in and
            around tourist facilities. Theft from parked cars, in hotels and on beaches is also on
            the rise. Valuables and travel documents should be kept in secure hotel facilities. Do
            not leave your bags unattended at the beach.

            Avoid deserted beaches and solo trips to the beach, other than at major hotels. Also,
            avoid poorly lit areas after dark and do not travel alone. Take care when hiking in
            remote areas.

            The police department has set up a beach security unit composed of police men and women
            that patrol the main public beaches.
            Road travel

            Traffic drives on the left. Seat belts are mandatory for drivers and front-seat
            passengers. Roads are generally well maintained, but are narrow and winding, often with
            sheer drops and few barriers. Drive defensively, particularly after dark. In the event
            of a traffic accident, remain at the scene until the police arrive.

            Car rentals are available. You are advised to purchase adequate car insurance. When
            returning a rented vehicle, ensure that you receive written acknowledgement stating that
            the vehicle has not been damaged.
            Public transportation

            Buses and taxis are available. Agree on the taxi fare beforehand. On the main islands of
            Mahe and Praslin, public transportation by bus is a viable option.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            Piracy

            Pirate attacks occur in coastal waters and, in some cases, farther out at sea. Mariners
            should take appropriate precautions. For additional information, consult the Live Piracy
            Report published by the International Maritime Bureau.
            General safety information

            Tourist facilities are generally well developed on the islands of Mahe, Praslin and La
            Digue.

            Visitors on maritime excursions should leave identification, travel documents and an
            itinerary with the hotel reception desk to assist the coast guard and police in the
            event of a problem. Carry a cell phone. Many islands are isolated, and travel by ship,
            including emergency travel, may be difficult in stormy weather.

            Strong currents make swimming dangerous in some locations.

            For emergency assistance on the islands of Mahe, Praslin and La Digue, call 999.

            Ebola

            The Government of Sierra Leone declared a state of public emergency due to the Ebola
            outbreak. This may lead to more rigid enforcement of quarantine measures and further
            restrictions on movement. Screening procedures for travellers in and out of affected
            areas are currently in place at health checkpoints. Some airlines have suspended flights
            to and from Freetown. Confirm the status of your flight with your airline. Air
            passengers may be subject to screening measures at the Freetown airport.
            Crime

            In general, the security condition in Sierra Leone has greatly improved since the end of
            the civil war in 2002. However, difficult economic conditions undermine an already
            fragile security environment, contributing to an increase in crime throughout the
            country. Pickpocketing and purse snatching are frequent in the main cities. Armed
            robberies, carjackings, and residential burglaries have been reported in expatriate and
            foreign officials’ homes. Burglars reportedly do not hesitate to use violence. There is
            a heightened risk of serious crimes after dark, and you are advised to stay in your
            hotel or residence once night falls.

            As visitors have been targeted, avoid walking alone, displaying any signs of affluence
            in public, and leaving valuables or bags unattended.

            You should be aware that local police have a limited capacity to investigate and may not
            be able to offer assistance.
            Demonstrations

            Sporadic incidents of violence can occur during public demonstrations, as shown by the
            politically motivated clashes that took place in March 2009 between supporters of the
            main political parties in different parts of the country, including in Freetown. Despite
            a negotiated peace agreement between political parties and an agreement reached with the
            help of the international community, the possibility of unrest remains. As robust
            security measures are often used by local police forces and injuries often occur during
            such clashes, you should avoid all public gatherings and demonstrations, which have the
            potential to suddenly turn violent. Remain vigilant, follow the advice of local
            authorities and monitor local media.

            Local transportation

            Local transportation services between Lungi International Airport and the city of
            Freetown are available by land (approximately four hours), by ferryboat (approximately
            one and a half hours), by helicopter (approximately 15 minutes) and by speed boat
            (approximately one hour). None of those options are risk-free and travel time may vary
            considerably during the rainy season.

            The helicopter service, which was suspended in 2007 following an incident that caused
            the death of all passengers, has resumed. You are advised to check for schedules and
            availability in advance for all transportation services.

            Public transportation (bus or group taxis) is poorly maintained and generally unsafe.
            There is no rail network. You should arrange for transportation prior to arrival.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            Road travel

            Other than the main roads (Freetown to Makeni or to Bo), roads are in poor condition and
            rarely paved outside Freetown. Moreover, their condition deteriorates significantly
            during the rainy season. Land travel outside Freetown should only be undertaken in a
            four-wheel-drive vehicle. Renting a car and driving yourself is not recommended, as
            overland travel can be hazardous.

            Travel after dark is particularly dangerous and is not recommended. There are no
            operating traffic lights, and most roads are unlit. Poor driving skills, overloaded
            vehicles, pedestrians routinely dodging traffic and roaming animals pose a hazard.
            Difficulties may be encountered at roadblocks and checkpoints, including requests for
            payments.
            General safety information

            Tourist facilities are extremely limited. When possible, check the level of security at
            hotels, lodges or any accommodation before making bookings.

            Travel outside the capital should be carefully planned. In remote regions, tourist
            facilities are almost non-existent. Also, certain essential services are lacking, and
            water and gas shortages occur from time to time.

            There are telephone networks throughout the country, although at times, in more remote
            locations, there may be no coverage. Telecommunications can be unreliable.

            You should always maintain sufficient supplies of food, water and other essentials.

            Carry your identification and vehicular documentation with you.

            Crime

            The crime rate is relatively low, and violent crime against foreigners is rare. However,
            there have been some reports of robberies and sexual assaults. Petty crime such as
            pickpocketing and purse snatching occurs, especially at the airport, hotels, public
            transportation facilities and other areas frequented by tourists. Ensure that your
            personal belongings, passports and other travel documents are secure at all times.
            Crimes, including passport theft, should be reported to the local police and the High
            Commission of Canada.
            Transportation

            Traffic drives on the left. Traffic regulations are strictly enforced.

            Public transportation is widely available and considered safe.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            Piracy

            Pirate attacks and armed robberies occur against ships in and around Singapore, in the
            Strait of Malacca, and between Riau Province in Indonesia and Singapore. Mariners should
            take appropriate precautions. For additional information, consult the Live Piracy Report
            published by the International Maritime Bureau.

        <item>
            Crime

            Petty crime occurs. Ensure that your personal belongings, passports and other travel
            documents are secure at all times. Armed robberies and tourists being chased by people
            on motorcycles have been reported. Avoid unpopulated areas and unpatrolled beaches after
            dark. Check with local authorities to determine which beaches are safe.
            Public transportation

            Taxis are plentiful and are a convenient way to get around during short stays. Princess
            Juliana International Airport, which serves both sides of the island, is located in Sint
            Maarten.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.

            Crime

            Petty crime (mugging, pickpocketing and purse snatching) occurs, especially in crowded
            areas and particularly during summer months. Foreigners are often targeted. Be vigilant
            in shopping centres, Christmas markets, public transportation stations, trains, hotels
            and major tourist attractions, including Bratislava\'s Old Town area. Remain vigilant in
            the presence of street children.

            Exercise extra caution on trains, particularly on Prague-Bratislava-Budapest or
            Budapest-Warsaw routes, and especially when travelling overnight.

            Thefts from parked cars have increased.

            Avoid public parks in city centres and railway stations after dark.
            Road travel

            Aggressive drivers and poorly lit and narrow roads pose hazards, especially in winter.
            Avoid travelling after dark in remote areas. Horse-drawn and slow-moving agricultural
            vehicles are common in rural areas.
            Public transportation

            Public transportation is well developed and reliable.

            Officially marked taxis are generally reliable, safe and economical, but it is advisable
            to pre-negotiate the fare. Beware of taxi drivers who try to overcharge by not switching
            on the meter.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            Scams

            Individuals posing as plainclothes police officers may ask to see your foreign currency
            and passport. If approached, decline to hand over personal belongings. Offer instead to
            go to the nearest police station or seek assistance from a local contact.

            See our Overseas Fraud page for more information on scams abroad.
            Spiked food and drinks

            Never leave food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers. Be wary of accepting
            snacks, beverages, gum or cigarettes from new acquaintances, as they may contain drugs
            that could put you at risk of sexual assault and robbery.
            General safety information

            Exercise normal safety precautions. Ensure that personal belongings, passports and other
            travel documents are secure at all times. Do not show signs of affluence.
            Emergency services

            Crime

            Violent crime is rare. Pickpocketing and purse snatching incidents occur, especially in
            crowded areas and on trains.
            Demonstrations and strikes

            Demonstrations may occur and have the potential to suddenly turn violent. Avoid all
            demonstrations and large gatherings, follow the advice of local authorities and monitor
            local media. Labour strikes may interfere with public transport and cause lengthy delays
            at border crossings.
            Road travel

            Main roads are generally safe and in good condition. Secondary roads tend to be narrow.
            Public transportation

            Use only officially marked taxis. Ensure that the meter is on and charging the
            appropriate rate, which should be displayed in the taxi.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            General safety information

            Exercise normal safety precautions. Ensure that your personal belongings, passports and
            other travel documents are secure at all times. Avoid showing signs of affluence and
            carrying large sums of cash.

            Carry adequate identification, such as your passport, at all times. Photocopies are not
            accepted. Keep a photocopy of your passport in case of loss or seizure.
            Emergency services

            Dial 112 for ambulance and 113 for police services.

            Crime

            Honiara has seen an increase in criminal activity, including armed gang violence,
            robberies and rape. Be careful when using public transportation in Honiara as two
            abductions were reported recently on local buses, one of which involved sexual assault.

            Violent crime against foreigners has occurred, including at night clubs and bars. Crimes
            such as burglary, assault, and car and house break-ins are a major concern, especially
            in Honiara. Police are limited in their ability to respond effectively. Ensure that your
            personal belongings, passports and other travel documents are secure at all times.

            Walking alone after dark is not recommended.
            Demonstrations

            There is a history of civil unrest, political violence and demonstrations, especially in
            Honiara. The possibility of violent demonstrations and civil unrest remains. Avoid all
            demonstrations and large gatherings and follow the advice of local authorities.
            Transportation

            Traffic drives on the left. Road conditions are poor and the only paved roads are in
            Honiara. Drivers have little regard for traffic regulations and do not follow safe
            driving practices.

            In early April 2014, severe flooding led to serious damages to many roads and bridges in
            Honiara and the province of Guadalcanal. Seek local advice if you plan to travel to
            affected regions.

            Inter-island ferries are often overcrowded and safety standards are minimal. Domestic
            flights may be cancelled without notice.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            General safety information

            Tourist facilities are limited, especially outside Honiara. Telecommunications are
            subject to disruptions.

            You are encouraged to register with the High Commission of Australia in Honiara in order
            to receive the latest information on situations and events that could affect your
            safety.

            Somaliland and Puntland

            Somaliland (a self-declared republic seeking independence) and Puntland (an
            administrative region in the northeast) have remained more stable than the south-central
            part of the country. Nonetheless, violent attacks on foreign targets have occurred in
            these regions. The United Kingdom continues to advise, in its travel advice for Somalia,
            that there is a specific threat to Westerners in Somaliland.

            Inter-clan conflicts often erupt into fighting in the Sanaag and Sool regions of
            Somaliland along the border with Puntland. Tensions and violence in the south of the
            country could spread to Somaliland and Puntland at any time.
            Terrorism

            There is a high threat from terrorism in Somalia. Regional terror groups, including al
            Qaeda and al-Shabaab, continue to threaten Western interests. Terrorist attacks against
            government targets involving the use of heavy weapons are frequent, particularly in
            Mogadishu. High-profile events could also be targeted. Public transportation, including
            the international airport, public venues such as hotels and restaurants, and
            international institutions have also been targeted, and civilian casualties are not
            uncommon. Two near-simultaneous explosions occurred near the Central Hotel in Mogadishu
            on February 20, 2015. The hotel was then ambushed by gunmen; at least ten people were
            killed and dozens injured during the attack. Further attacks cannot be ruled out. Be
            vigilant in crowded places and monitor local media.
            Kidnappings

            Foreigners are at very high risk of being kidnapped throughout Somalia, including in
            Somaliland. Several Westerners, including humanitarian workers, have been kidnapped in
            recent years.
            Crime

            There are high levels of crime conducted by armed militias throughout the country. Armed
            robberies, carjackings and murders occur regularly.
            Demonstrations

            Protests, civil unrest and violent incidents occur in Mogadishu, often in response to
            the rising costs of food and living. Outbreaks of violence can arise unpredictably, and
            parties involved are often armed. These violent incidents tend to cause civilian
            casualties. Avoid all public gatherings and areas where demonstrations may occur.
            Land and air travel

            Mogadishu Aden Adde International Airport is often closed with little or no warning due
            to fighting.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.

            The land border between Kenya and Somalia remains closed and air traffic between the two
            countries is subject to special procedures by the Kenyan government.
            General safety information

            Tourist facilities are not available. Electricity and water provisions are not assured.
            International telephone services and Internet access are limited to larger cities, where
            services are unreliable.
            Piracy

            Acts of piracy against ships off the Somali coast have increased. Mariners should take
            appropriate precautions. For additional information, consult the Live Piracy Report
            published by the International Maritime Bureau.

            Crime

            South Africa has a very high level of crime. Crime is the primary security threat to
            travellers.

            Violent crimes, including rape and murder, routinely occur and have involved foreigners.
            Muggings, armed assaults and theft are also frequent, often occurring in areas that are
            popular among tourists. Carjackings and cases of robbery and assault have been reported
            as well.

            Armed robberies at shopping malls have increased. If confronted by an armed individual,
            you are advised to immediately comply, avoid making sudden movements, avoid resisting or
            antagonizing the assailants and avoid eye contact with your assailant.

            Crime significantly increases after dark in major city centres and townships. After
            dark, avoid the areas of Berea, Hillbrow and Yeoville in Johannesburg, Sunnyside in
            Pretoria, and the beachfront and Victoria wharf in Durban. In Cape Town, avoid walking
            from downtown hotels to the waterfront.

            Outbreaks of violence and looting have taken place in and around Johannesburg and
            Pretoria, and could reoccur with little warning. Monitor local media and follow the
            advice of local authorities.
            Common criminal strategies

            Be on the alert for ploys to stop your vehicle. Criminals have been known to create
            bogus accidents or roadblocks (sometimes putting debris in the road) and to throw rocks,
            bricks and paint from freeway overpasses onto moving vehicles to damage cars and
            disorientate drivers. The criminal then waits for the driver to pull over or exit the
            car before grabbing exposed valuables and/or stealing the vehicle.

            Criminals are known to pose as police officers to extort and rob tourists, including by
            stopping tourist buses or rented cars to check proof of identity and search luggage. You
            are advised to not pull over on the side of the road, put on your hazard lights and
            slowly drive to a gas station, police station or other safe and populated area.

            Be especially vigilant at vulnerable points such as traffic lights, stop signs, yield
            signs and highway off-ramps. Smash and grab incidents are frequent, where car windows
            are broken and valuables such as handbags are taken while cars are wait at junctions.
            Park in well-lit areas, do not pick up strangers and ensure that vehicle doors are
            locked and windows are closed at all times.
            Hotel theft

            Theft, including from hotel rooms and guest houses, is common. Never leave your windows
            or doors open or unlocked, even when you are present. Check the level of security at
            guest houses, hotels, lodges, backpacker lodges or any accommodation before making
            bookings. Do not leave luggage and valuables unattended, and place them in safekeeping
            facilities. Do not open the door to anyone without taking necessary precautions. If
            someone claims to be a member of staff, verify with the reception prior to opening the
            door.
            Automated banking machines

            Attacks on automated banking machines (ABMs), in which criminals use explosives to gain
            access to the cash box, have increased throughout the country. Be particularly vigilant
            and do not let yourself get distracted at ABMs, as assaults on people using them occur.
            Although attacks usually take place in isolated areas and early in the morning, some
            have been perpetrated in high-traffic areas. Do not attempt to use ABMs that appear
            damaged or defective, or that are located in isolated or poorly lit areas. Also, do not
            accept any offer of assistance with your transaction. If suspicious at any time, cancel
            your transaction and use another ABM. Whenever possible, do not withdraw money from an
            ABM at a gas station, since these are often targeted by criminals. Avoid using ABMs at
            night and, if possible, have someone accompany you to watch the area during your
            transaction.
            Regional unrest

            Xenophobic attacks primarily targeting refugees or immigrants from other African
            nations, and outbreaks of violence and looting are occurring in central Durban and
            several surrounding areas such as Umlazi and KwaMashu. This type of unrest has also been
            reported in and around Johannesburg and Pretoria, and could reoccur in any region of the
            country with little warning. Avoid large gatherings and demonstrations, and monitor
            local media and follow the advice of local authorities at all times.
            Demonstrations

            The political situation is stable in South Africa, however, nationwide strikes and
            demonstrations occur frequently and have the potential to suddenly turn violent. Avoid
            large gatherings and demonstrations, stay away from locations where they may be held and
            follow the advice of local authorities at all times. Monitor local media and other
            sources of information for updates on security risks, demonstrations, public gatherings
            and trade union workers’ strikes.
            Road travel

            Traffic drives on the left. Road conditions are generally good, but some roads in the
            more remote areas are less well maintained and potholes may be encountered. Drive
            cautiously at all times and adhere to speed limits.

            Traffic lights are frequently out of order. Treat all intersections with malfunctioning
            traffic lights as a four-way stop. At traffic circles (roundabouts) drivers should give
            way to the right, although this rule is often ignored.

            Avoid driving in close proximity to armored vehicles transporting cash as they are often
            the target of attacks on the road.

            Avoid undertaking overland travel after dark. Insufficient lighting on rural roads makes
            it difficult to see pedestrians, wild animals and stray livestock. Pedestrians are known
            to cross major highways.

            There are many road accidents causing death in South Africa. Alcohol and poor driving
            standards, such as ignoring traffic signs, speeding and indiscriminate overtaking, are
            often contributing factors, particularly at night. Accidents can happen if you drive in
            wet conditions, as roads get very slippery. Observe the recommended following distances.

            Beware of relying solely on global positioning system (GPS) navigation devices, as they
            may direct you through unsafe areas. Verify your route prior to departure.

            When renting a vehicle, choose one with a robust central locking system, lockable fuel
            tank cap and vehicle alarm. Use a reliable company offering 24-hour emergency service,
            and ensure that you have the contact details for the service.

            It is illegal to carry gasoline in portable containers.
            Make sure you carry identification and your valid drivers’ licence in English at all
            times.
            Public transportation

            Public transport is not recommended. Tourists have been mugged and assaulted in and
            around bus stations. Avoid the central bus station in Johannesburg. Train travel is not
            recommended, especially second or third class. Services are slow and several serious
            accidents in recent years have raised concerns over safety standards. Violent attacks
            have also taken place on local commuter and metro trains between Johannesburg and
            Pretoria, as well as on commuter trains in Cape Town. However, the Gautrain between O.R.
            Tambo International Airport in Johannesburg and Pretoria, as well as the Blue Train and
            Rovos Rail, are safe for tourists.

            Taxis cannot be hailed in the street. Ask your hotel to arrange a taxi and ensure that
            you prearrange transport for your return journey. Sit in the rear of the vehicle and
            keep windows up and doors locked at all times. Keep valuables out of sight and place
            bags by your feet. It is advisable to negotiate the fare with the driver in advance.
            Avoid using minibuses and unlicensed taxis.

            Passport theft and baggage pilferage are prevalent at both international and regional
            airports. All valuables should be placed in your hand luggage. Where possible, suitcases
            should be locked and wrapped in secure plastic film. This service is available at most
            airports for a nominal fee.

            Do not accept unsolicited offers of assistance with carrying your luggage or pushing
            your luggage trolley. Remain vigilant and do not leave any bag unattended, even for a
            moment. Be on the alert at X-ray machines while having your hand-held baggage scanned;
            where possible, accompany your luggage through these stations. There has been a string
            of thefts inside the secure area of the international terminal at the O.R. Tambo airport
            in Johannesburg (after the security checkpoint and past immigration).

            Arrange to be met at the airport upon arrival and dropped off for departure by reliable
            contacts. Clearly identify who is picking you up before getting into their vehicle.
            Criminals have been known to replicate passengers’ names on signs in the arrivals area
            in order to rob them. Confirm the identity of the person meeting you. There have been
            incidents of passengers being followed from airports to their accommodation and robbed.
            Should you be concerned that you are being followed, proceed to the first available gas
            station or police station for assistance.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            Reserves and safaris

            There are inherent risks associated with viewing wildlife, both marine and on land,
            particularly on foot or at close range. You should always maintain a safe distance when
            observing wildlife and avoid exiting vehicles unless it is deemed safe to do so by
            professional guides and wardens. Use only reputable and professional guides or tour
            operators, and closely follow park regulations and wardens’ advice.

            There have been attacks on hikers and tourists at reserves and hiking trails, including
            Table Mountain. Some attacks have been violent. Authorities are attempting to address
            the problem, and recommend that visitors walk in groups and take all appropriate
            precautions.

            Avoid isolated picnic areas and beaches. Do not stop at deserted roadside resting places
            on national roads, and be aware that travellers have been attacked and robbed in parking
            areas at tourist attractions. Be aware of the threat of monkeys and baboons overwhelming
            sightseers in their search for food. They are known to get very aggressive.
            Beaches

            Coastal waters have unpredictable wave and currents patterns, which can be dangerous.
            Follow the advice and warnings of local authorities. Shark attacks have been reported in
            several areas, including in KwaZulu-Natal and Western Cape.

            Be cautious when swimming in lakes and rivers because of the risk posed by wildlife.
            Townships and rural areas

            Avoid townships and informal settlements if you are unfamiliar with them, except when
            travelling with organized tours provided by a reputable company or in association with
            an experienced local organization.
            Fraud

            Cases of attempted fraud are frequently reported in South Africa. Do not give personal
            or financial account information to anyone. There are international fraud rings
            operating in South Africa that target visitors, foreign businesspeople and charities.

            Flagrant soliciting of bribes occurs, especially by police officers who may stop drivers
            for no apparent reason.

            Secure all automated banking machine (ABM) and credit card payment slips and keep your
            credit card in sight at all times when using it. Mobile phones and card skimmers have
            been used to copy credit card details. Request a mobile card machine at restaurants and
            make sure your card is visible at all times during the transaction.

            If you wish to report an attempted fraud, call the South African Police Service at 08600
            10111. See Overseas Fraud for more information.
            General safety information

            A load shedding program (rolling blackouts) is currently in effect in parts of South
            Africa, leaving different areas without electrical power for a predetermined period of
            time. Consult Eskom’s website to view its load shedding schedule. Blackouts could take
            place on short notice in the case of power shortages. Consider preparing a basic
            emergency kit.

            Interruptions to the supply of water occur from time to time and can be lengthy in some
            areas, resulting in considerable inconvenience.

            Do not show signs of affluence, display money or carry valuables such as laptop
            computers or cameras. When at restaurants or bars, do not leave your bag under your
            chair or table or hung over the back of a chair; keep it on your lap. There is a high
            risk of pickpocketing. Men should not put their wallets in their back pocket. Ensure
            that all zippers, straps and fasteners are closed and secure, and be aware of people
            behind and around you.

            Do not leave your food or drink unattended. There have been incidents of food or drink
            being drugged and tourists robbed when unconscious.

            Criminals are known to target people who appear preoccupied and are not paying attention
            to their immediate surroundings.

            If you believe that you are being followed, go directly to a police station.

            As a pedestrian, take extreme care when crossing streets. Drivers are often aggressive
            toward pedestrians and fail to yield the right of way even on marked crosswalks.

            Travel on foot is inadvisable in most areas. If walking is unavoidable, use only
            brightly lit, busy streets in popular tourist areas and maintain awareness of your
            surroundings at all times. Avoid walking after dark.

            Always carry a cellular phone in the event of an emergency. If using your own phone,
            ensure that it has international/roaming capability for use while in South Africa.
            Rental mobile phones are available at all major airports.

            Cellular phone reception is generally good in major towns and cities but can be
            intermittent in rural areas.

            Nationwide, dial 10111 for police emergencies, and 10177 for ambulance services.

            Jonglei state

            The situation is extremely volatile in Jonglei state (more specifically close to Bor and
            in Akobo and Nassir), where sustained fighting and inter-ethnic violence has been
            reported since mid-December 2013. Anti-government forces are in control of much of the
            countryside, while the government retains control of Bor.
            Northern Regions: Unity, Upper Nile, Northern Warrap, Jonglei, Lakes and Northern Bahr
            el-Ghazal states

            Anti-government forces are in control of much of the countryside of Unity and Upper Nile
            states, while the government retains control of Malakal and Bentiu.

            Over the past two years, occasional tensions between South Sudan and Sudan have led to
            increased military activity in regions bordering Sudan, and both states have threatened
            to escalate their activities. Aerial bombardments have been occasionally reported in
            Unity state (including the town of Bentiu), Upper Nile state, and Northern Bahr el
            Ghazal state. Since South Sudan’s secession, fighting in the border regions has
            displaced tens of thousands of people on both sides of the border, according to the
            United Nations.

            Be aware of security threats in the oil development region (including Unity, Northern
            Warrap, and Northern Jonglei states). Oil installations and the surrounding areas are
            potential targets for military and rebel attacks.

            The Abyei region, which borders Northern Bahr el Ghazal, Warrap, and Unity states, is a
            disputed territory between Sudan and South Sudan. Since 2011, the Abyei region has been
            the site of frequent fighting and mass displacement.

            Inter-tribal conflict and cattle rustling are becoming prevalent in Lakes state.
            Tensions are particularly high in the county of Rumbek East. If you remain in the area,
            restrict your movement and avoid the road connecting Rumbek and Yirol.
            Restrictions on movement

            Although no official curfew is currently in effect, we recommend that you remain at home
            from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. for security reasons. Road blocks are frequently erected after
            dark.

            The border crossing with Uganda at Nimule, in the state of Eastern Equatoria, has
            recently been subject to short periods of closure by the South Sudanese authorities.

            Increasingly frequent fuel shortages may impede your ability to move freely at short
            notice, and could lead to unexpected shortages of basic foodstuffs. Take adequate
            precautions.
            Terrorism

            Regional terror groups, including those associated with al Qaeda and al-Shabaab,
            continue to threaten Western interests and other potential targets in South Sudan. The
            September 21, 2013 attack on an upscale Nairobi mall illustrates the threat of attacks
            on civilians in East Africa. Further attacks cannot be ruled out. Be vigilant in crowded
            places and monitor local media.
            Crime

            There is widespread violent crime, including kidnappings, armed robbery, carjackings and
            compound invasion, throughout South Sudan. The security risk is especially high in Juba,
            which has seen regular outbreaks of violence and lawlessness and increasing numbers of
            carjackings. The recent economic downturn has led to a significant increase in the
            number of crimes involving guns. Foreigners have been victims of those crimes in 2015.
            Law enforcement personnel have limited capacity to deter crime.
            Demonstrations

            Demonstrations occur and have the potential to suddenly turn violent. They can lead to
            significant disruptions to traffic and public transportation. Avoid all demonstrations
            and large gatherings, follow the advice of local authorities and monitor local media.
            Road travel

            Landmines pose a threat, especially outside of Juba. Road conditions are extremely poor.
            Many roads are sand tracks. A four-wheel-drive vehicle is required except in some urban
            areas such as Juba and Malakal, especially during the rainy season (March to November).
            Only experienced and fully equipped travellers should undertake desert travel; basic
            equipment should include a shovel, metal ramps for heavy sand, a Global Positioning
            System (GPS) device, spare fuel and water supplies. Roadblocks are common. You should
            have your identity and vehicle documents readily available. Unpredictable local driving
            habits, pedestrians and roaming animals pose risks.
            Public transportation

            A few taxis are available in urban centres but are generally old and uncomfortable.
            Public transportation is limited outside of major urban areas.

            Only top-of-the-line buses should be used; most other buses are irregularly scheduled,
            poorly maintained and very badly driven. Fatal accidents involving buses are routine,
            and have increased in the past few years.

            You should arrive at Juba\'s international airport at least two - and preferably three -
            hours before departure. Departure formalities are complicated and non-computerized.
            There is no sign board to indicate departure and arrival times and you should expect
            delays. Be advised that flights out of Juba are subject to sporadic suspension.
            Additional documents may be required for entry when flying from Khartoum.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            General security information

            Telecommunications are unreliable. Blackberry devices do not function in South Sudan.

        <item>
            Flight disruptions

            Due to frequent airline strikes in Spain, flight cancellations and delays may be
            expected. Check the status of your flight directly with your airline.
            Crime

            Violent crime is rare. Although assaults against foreigners are infrequent, reports of
            such attacks in connection with petty crime are a concern.

            Petty crime (pickpocketing, purse snatching and other robberies) against tourists
            occurs, especially in larger cities and around tourist attractions during holidays,
            festivals and weekends. Thieves are especially active in crowded areas, such as
            airports, public transportation facilities, roads, hotel lobbies, restaurants, outdoor
            cafés and tourist attractions. Be extremely cautious with your belongings at all times
            and in all places.

            Thieves work alone or in groups. They use various techniques to distract their victims
            and steal their belongings. They may also pose as police officers, asking victims to
            show them valuable belongings (passports, money or cameras); or they may act like Good
            Samaritans and pretend to help.

            In the event of a road-related incident, be extremely cautious about accepting help from
            anyone other than a uniformed Spanish police officer or Civil Guard. Thieves have been
            known to fake or provoke a flat tire, and when a motorist stops to help, the thieves
            steal the motorist’s car or belongings. The reverse scenario has also occurred, whereby
            a fake Good Samaritan stops to help a motorist in distress, only to steal the motorist’s
            car or belongings.

            In Madrid, known high-risk locations for thieves are the Puerta del Sol area and
            surrounding streets, Gran Vìa, Plaza Mayor, near the Prado Museum, the Atocha train
            station, Retiro Park and on the subway. In Barcelona, thefts occur most frequently at
            the airport and on the airport shuttle bus (Aerobus), on Las Ramblas (often in Internet
            cafés), in Plaza Real and surrounding streets of the old city, on the subway,
            Barceloneta beach, Sagrada Familia church, and at the Sants train and bus station.

            Theft from rental vehicles is high. Be vigilant in service areas on the highways along
            the coast. Avoid leaving any luggage or valuables in the vehicle and use secure parking
            facilities.

            More Canadian passports are stolen each year in Spain than anywhere else in the world.
            Ensure that your passport is protected at all times.
            Terrorism

            On January 7, 2015, the Spanish Interior Ministry raised the terrorism threat level for
            Spain from level 2 to level 3 on a scale of 1 to 4. Expect increased surveillance and
            police presence in areas that may be considered prime targets, such as transportation
            hubs (airports, train stations) and key infrastructure.

            On October 20, 2011, the Basque terrorist group ETA (Euskadi Ta Askatasuna – “Basque
            Homeland and Liberty”) announced a definitive cessation of its armed activities. Over
            the past five decades ETA has carried out numerous shootings and bombings across Spain,
            resulting in many deaths and injuries. The most recent incidents include small-scale
            bombings that occurred on the island of Mallorca in July and August 2009, a bombing in
            Madrid in February 2009, and another one in Arrigorriaga in the Basque region in June
            2009. Spanish institutions, tourist destinations and transportation hubs have been prime
            targets in the past. While ETA has renounced violence, protests or rallies may be held
            to promote the cause of Basque independence. Exercise caution at all times and in all
            places, monitor local news reports and follow the advice of local authorities.

            In addition, there is still a risk of Islamist terrorist attacks. On March 11, 2004, a
            series of coordinated bomb attacks took place targeting the Madrid commuter train
            system. The attacks caused 191 deaths and wounded 1,800 people.
            Demonstrations and strikes

            Demonstrations occur and have the potential to suddenly turn violent. Avoid all
            demonstrations and large gatherings, follow the advice of local authorities and monitor
            local media.

            Strikes may occasionally lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.
            Road travel

            Be cautious when driving in Spain as driving habits are different from those in Canada.

            Travellers may experience delays crossing between Spain and Gibraltar due to increased
            border controls.
            Public transportation

            All major cities have metered taxis. Any extra charges must be posted in the vehicle.
            Beware of taxi drivers who try to overcharge by not turning on the meter.

            Rail service is reliable and high-speed trains link major cities.

            Intercity buses are usually comfortable and inexpensive.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            Scams

            Canadians have reported lottery scams whereby they are contacted via the Internet or fax
            and informed that they have won a substantial prize in the Spanish lottery (El Gordo),
            when in fact they have never participated in the lottery. They are asked to deposit an
            amount of money in a bank account to pay taxes and other fees before collecting the
            prize or coming to Spain to close the transaction.

            There have also been reports of a scam whereby a person is informed that he or she is
            the recipient of a large inheritance, and that funds must be deposited into a Spanish
            bank account so the inheritance can be processed.

            In another common scam, some Canadians have received a bogus email purportedly sent from
            an individual well known to them and claiming that he or she is in trouble and needs
            funds.

            See our Overseas Fraud page for more information on scams abroad.
            Spiked food and drinks

            Never leave food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers. Be wary of accepting
            snacks, beverages, gum or cigarettes from new acquaintances, as they may contain drugs
            that could put you at risk of sexual assault and robbery.
            General safety measures

            Exercise normal safety precautions. Ensure that your personal belongings, passports and
            other travel documents are secure at all times. Keep a copy of your passport
            identification page, driver’s licence, train or airline tickets, and credit cards.
            Safeguard the originals.

            Do not leave luggage unattended at any check-in or ticket counter and in hotel lobbies.
            When travelling by car, always keep valuable belongings out of sight and keep the
            windows closed.

            Avoid frequenting unlit areas and down-market bars, especially at night.

            East and North

            Special security measures remain in place in the East and the North, including in the
            Jaffna Peninsula. Travel restrictions for foreigners may be applied without notice.
            Demining operations are ongoing; however, unmarked landmines remain. Pay attention to
            signs warning of mines and avoid travelling off the main A-9 road. Caches of weapons
            continue to be found.

            The resettlement of internally displaced persons is also ongoing. Reports of increased
            criminal activities and land disputes have been more frequent recently.

            Some Canadians of Tamil origin report difficulties, including arrest or detention,
            during screening and security operations. Ensure that you carry proper identification at
            all times.
            Crime

            Violent crime occurs. There has been an increase in the number of violent incidents
            (assaults) in remote areas of the country since August 2011, primarily in the northern,
            eastern and central provinces. There has also been a substantial increase in harassment
            and assault cases aimed at Western foreigners. Foreigners have been targeted in
            incidents of drink spiking, often combined with sexual assault or theft. Never leave
            food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers, and pay attention when drinks are
            being prepared and served. Seek immediate medical attention if you suspect that you have
            been drugged.

            Petty crime such as purse snatching and pickpocketing is on the rise, especially on
            public transportation. Theft has occurred in hotels and guesthouses. Ensure that your
            personal belongings, passports and travel documents are secure at all times. Credit card
            fraud is common. Pay very close attention when your credit card is being handled. Cash
            transactions are recommended.
            Women’s safety

            Women are often the target for unwanted attention. They should exercise caution when
            travelling alone. Consult our publication entitled Her Own Way: A Woman’s Safe-Travel
            Guide for travel safety information specifically aimed at Canadian women.
            Demonstrations

            Avoid all demonstrations and large gatherings, as they have the potential to suddenly
            turn violent, and follow the advice of local authorities.
            Inter-communal tensions

            Inter-communal tensions, including religious tensions, remain throughout the country,
            and have increased in 2014. Ethnically-motivated violence took place on June 15, 2014,
            in the coastal towns of Aluthgama (near Bentota) and Beruwala, in Southern Province.
            Further violent incidents cannot be ruled out. Curfews may be imposed on short notice.
            Transportation

            Traffic drives on the left. Road conditions are usually poor outside major cities. Road
            accidents, often causing death and injuries, are common due to poorly maintained
            vehicles and erratic driving practices. Travel by bus is generally unsafe due to
            aggressive drivers and the risk of theft.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            Piracy

            Pirate attacks occur in coastal waters and, in some cases, farther out at sea. Mariners
            should take appropriate precautions. For additional information, consult the Live Piracy
            Report published by the International Maritime Bureau.
            Swimming

            Swimming conditions may be unsafe. Follow the advice and warnings of local authorities.
            Tourist facilities

            Tourist facilities are widely available but quality varies, especially inland. Travel to
            remote areas should be arranged through a reputable travel agency.

            Darfur (see Advisory)

            You should leave if you are in Darfur. The conflict in Darfur has created a dangerous
            situation in western Sudan, particularly outside the major towns. It also affects other
            areas of Sudan and eastern Chad. Despite the signing of a preliminary peace agreement,
            the security situation in Darfur remains extremely volatile, and lawlessness is
            prevalent. The region has seen sporadic fighting between the government and rebels
            groups, and carjacking, break-ins and kidnapping remain a genuine threat to foreigners.
            Violence regularly breaks out within camps for internally displaced people. Humanitarian
            workers and United Nations (U.N.) peacekeepers have been attacked and kidnapped. Curfews
            are sometimes put in effect by the government. Recent violence has resulted in deaths,
            displacement of people, and general instability and insecurity. Further clashes and
            regional violence cannot be ruled out.
            Abyei region, Southern Kordofan, Blue Nile, Northern Kordofan and White Nile states (see

            You should leave if you are in Abyei administrative region, Southern Kordofan or Blue
            Nile states. Both Sudan and South Sudan claim Abyei, and there is continued fighting in
            South Kordofan and Blue Nile between government forces and rebels. Fighting between the
            Sudanese Armed Forces and rebel groups has escalated significantly since the
            independence of South Sudan in July 2011. There is a heightened risk of attacks in the
            region. Armed groups have carried out attacks on foreign workers, including oil field
            workers. Militias and disenfranchised groups have stated on several occasions that they
            regard oil installations as legitimate targets, and have conducted recent attacks on oil
            infrastructure. Be aware of security threats if you are in the oil development region
            despite this advisory. Sudan has declared a state of emergency in the states bordering
            South Sudan and has suspended all flights to and from South Sudan.

            Tensions in the states bordering South Sudan could spread to parts of Northern Kordofan
            and White Nile states. We advise against all travel to the area south of the Kosti–El
            Obeid–En Nahud road.
            Area bordering Eritrea in Red Sea State (see Advisory)

            The security situation in the area comprised within 100 km of the border with Eritrea,
            in Red Sea State is volatile due to cross-border militant activity. Foreigners working
            for aid organizations in this area have been the target of attacks.
            Elections and demonstrations

            Presidential and legislative elections are scheduled to take place from April 13 to 15,
            2015. Related demonstrations and unrest could occur during the period surrounding these
            elections.

            Large demonstrations occur regularly across Sudan, including in Khartoum. Clashes
            between protesters and security forces have led to casualties on occasion. Avoid all
            demonstrations, monitor local news and follow the advice of local authorities.
            Kidnapping

            Westerners face the risk of being kidnapped even in Khartoum. Maintain a heightened
            level of vigilance in Khartoum and consider regularly modifying your patterns of travel.
            Increased threat of attacks and kidnappings

            In 2013, the French military assisted the Malian government in efforts to repel armed
            rebels. Terrorist groups in the region declared their intention to increase attacks and
            kidnappings targeting Westerners. While the United Nations peacekeeping mission in Mali
            has been supporting the transitional authorities in stabilizing the region since July
            2013, citizens of countries supporting the intervention are still at particular risk,
            but all travellers should exercise increased vigilance in the region.
            Crime

            While the incidence of crime in Khartoum is low, incidents of petty crime are
            increasing.

            Banditry is increasing throughout western Sudan, especially in the Darfur region
            (particularly the Chad–Sudan border region), where several incidents have resulted in
            deaths.
            General safety information

            For national security reasons, individuals working for international organizations could
            be subject to random searches of personal effects by Sudanese authorities.

            Tourist facilities are limited. The locations frequented by tourists are the Meroe and
            Jebel Barkal archaeological sites, and dive sites on the Red Sea.
            Road travel

            Road conditions are poor. Many roads outside the capital are sand tracks. A
            four-wheel-drive vehicle is required for overland travel except on the
            Khartoum–Kassala–Port Sudan, Khartoum–Atbara, and Khartoum–El Obeid highways. Only
            experienced and fully equipped travellers should undertake desert travel; basic
            equipment should include a shovel, metal ramps for heavy sand, a global positioning
            system (GPS), spare fuel and water supplies. Roadblocks are common. Have your identity
            and vehicle documents readily available. Unpredictable local driving habits, pedestrians
            and roaming animals pose serious risks.
            Public transportation

            Public transportation is limited outside of major urban areas. Taxis are available in
            urban centres but are generally old and uncomfortable. Khartoum has a metered taxi
            service but drivers rarely speak English or French. It is recommended to have your
            destination written down in Arabic.

            A weekly train service operates between Wadi Halfa and Khartoum. Trains are dilapidated,
            but service is punctual. Travel only in top-of-the-line buses; most other buses are
            irregularly scheduled, poorly maintained and very badly driven. Fatal accidents
            involving buses are routine.

            The only regular surface access from Egypt is by ferry from Aswan, Egypt, to Wadi Halfa,
            Sudan. There are ferries to and from the Red Sea port of Suakin.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            Border crossings

            The land borders with many surrounding countries are closed. Border closures may occur
            without notice. Check with local authorities for up-to-date information. Attempting to
            cross land borders is dangerous and not recommended.

            Commercial overland expeditions occasionally cross Sudan’s land borders with Libya, the
            Central African Republic and Chad, but these routes are dangerous. There are landmines
            in many areas outside the main cities, including border areas.
            Piracy

            Pirate attacks occur in coastal waters, and in some cases, further out at sea. Mariners
            should take appropriate precautions. For additional information, consult the Live Piracy
            Report published by the International Maritime Bureau.
        </item>

            Crime

            Violent and petty crime such as pickpocketing and robbery are common in the capital,
            Paramaribo, and outlying areas, especially in the major business and shopping districts.
            Foreigners are particularly targeted. Ensure that your personal belongings, passports
            and travel documents are secure at all times. Do not show signs of affluence. Avoid
            walking alone after dark outside the immediate vicinity of major hotels. Theft from
            vehicles also occurs.

            Banditry and lawlessness are a problem in the cities of Albina and Moengo, and along the
            East-West Highway between Paramaribo and Albina. The Palm Garden (“Palmentuin”) in the
            Dutch area of Paramaribo should be avoided after dark due to illicit activities and the
            lack of police presence.
            Demonstrations

            Demonstrations, protests, marches and strikes may occur at any time in the capital,
            throughout the country and on main highways; sometimes they become violent. Local
            transportation services can be disrupted. Roadblocks may occur on main roads at any
            time, causing traffic disruptions. Do not attempt to cross blockades, even if they
            appear unattended. Because of the unpredictable nature of these demonstrations and the
            potential for violence, avoid large gatherings and demonstrations, and monitor local
            news reports.
            Road travel

            Traffic drives on the left. Road conditions are different from those in Canada. Many
            thoroughfares do not have sidewalks, forcing pedestrians and bicycles to share the road.
            In Paramaribo, most roads are paved but not well maintained. Poor road conditions,
            inadequate lighting, dangerous driving and poorly maintained vehicles pose hazards. Road
            conditions are worst during and after the rainy seasons. In the interior, some roads are
            impassable and some bridges are in disrepair.

            Because of the possibility of theft or banditry, drive with windows closed and doors
            locked.

            Check the latest conditions with the Foundation for Nature Conservation at:

            Email: stinasu@sr.net

            Car rentals are available. Vehicles with foreign plates are required to undergo a
            vehicle overhaul test to ensure that the vehicle meets Surinamese traffic standards. The
            owner will then be granted a Surinamese licence plate. Avoid driving motorcycles or
            scooters.
            Public transportation

            Avoid using public minibuses. Taxis are available at major hotels. Agree on a fare prior
            to departure. Air-conditioned taxis will charge more. Do not hail taxis on the street,
            as they tend to overcharge foreigners.

            Domestic flights are subject to delays.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            Trekking

            The dense jungle and local fauna can be hazardous. Contact local authorities for the
            latest security and travel information.

            If you intend to trek:

            a) never trek alone;
            b) always hire an experienced guide and ensure that the trekking company is reputable;
            c) buy travel health insurance that includes helicopter rescue and medical evacuation;
            d) ensure that you are in top physical condition;
            e) advise a family member or friend of your itinerary;
            f) know the symptoms of acute altitude sickness, which can be fatal;
            g) register with the Consulate of Canada in Paramaribo; and
            h) obtain detailed information on trekking routes before setting out.
            General security information

            Telecommunication services are poor, especially during heavy rains.
            Emergency services

            Police response, especially at night, is rare for all but the most serious crimes.
            Police presence outside Paramaribo is scarce.

            Dial 115 for local police, 110 for fire fighters, and 113 for ambulance services.

            Crime

            Petty crime, including theft of money or personal property, occurs. Do not show signs of
            affluence, and ensure personal belongings and travel documents are secure. Violent crime
            is less prevalent but increasing. Armed carjackings, burglaries, car thefts and muggings
            have occurred, mostly in Manzini, Mbabane and rural areas. Avoid walking in these areas
            after dark. Do not pick up hitchhikers. You should view offers of roadside assistance
            with caution.

            In 2013, there have been several reported incidents of carjackings in Mozambique, close
            to border crossings with Swaziland, by individuals impersonating police officers. Be
            aware that only officers from the Policia de Republica de Moçambique have the authority
            to establish checkpoints. Official checkpoints are always staffed by four officers and a
            clearly visible vehicle. Take precautions when being flagged at checkpoints.
            Demonstrations and strikes

            Demonstrations periodically take place and can lead to violent clashes between state
            security forces and protestors. You are advised to carry appropriate identification, and
            to avoid large crowds and areas where demonstrations may occur. Maintain a high level of
            personal security awareness at all times, monitor local news reports and follow the
            advice of local authorities.

            Mass labour strikes have crippled the nation for several days at a time. The possibility
            of further labour and political unrest exists and could result in violence.
            Road travel

            Traffic drives on the left. Drivers often cross the median to avoid hazards, and by so
            doing can cause head-on collisions. Speeding is also a serious concern. National roads,
            including a new divided expressway between Mbabane and Manzini, are relatively good, but
            many others are unimproved dirt roads. Sidewalks are rare, and motorists share the roads
            with pedestrians and cyclists. Roaming livestock, abandoned unlit trailers and heavy
            vehicles pose hazards.

            Overland travel should be undertaken during daylight hours as most roads lack adequate
            lighting. Poor visibility is exacerbated by frequent fog conditions and severe storms,
            especially in the High Veld, close to Mbabane, and in forest regions near the South
            African border. Motorists should obtain comprehensive insurance, carry original vehicle
            registration documents, and ensure the vehicle is equipped with seat belts and a
            breakdown-warning triangle. There are car rental agencies at Matsapha International
            Airport.

            There are 11 border entry posts with South Africa and two with Mozambique. Most operate
            between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. Entering Swaziland from South Africa on the N4 via the Oshoek
            border should not be done after dark due to a risk of hijacking. You should exercise
            caution at the Oshoek border, where major road construction is under way and there is a
            risk of accidents. Consult local authorities for road conditions and schedules prior to
            cross-border travel. You should also review the Travel Advice for South Africa, since
            most travel to Swaziland involves transit through that country.
            Public transportation

            Avoid using buses and taxis, which are often poorly maintained and overloaded.

            Avoid travelling by train if possible.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.

            Crime

            The crime rate is lower in Sweden than in most European countries. Petty crime (such as
            pickpocketing and purse snatching) occurs in areas frequented by tourists, such as
            Stockholm’s Old Town and the Central Station, in restaurants and on public
            transportation, particularly in urban areas during the summer months. Pickpockets and
            purse snatchers may work in teams; one distracts the victim and another commits the
            robbery. Hotel lobbies and breakfast rooms attract professional, well-dressed thieves.
            Remain vigilant and ensure your valuables are secure at all times.

            Incidences of gang and organized crime-related violence have been on the increase in
            southern Sweden, including in the cities of Gothenburg and Malmo, since 2014. While
            these incidents have not occurred in areas typically frequented by tourists, travellers
            should monitor local media to keep informed of the advice of local authorities. Several
            car bombs were reported in Malmo at the end of 2014. On March 18, 2015, an attack
            occurred at a restaurant in Gothenburg, killing at least two people. Monitor local media
            to keep informed of the current situation and follow the advice of local authorities.
            Demonstrations

            Demonstrations occur periodically and, while they are normally peaceful, have the
            potential to suddenly turn violent. Avoid all demonstrations, follow the advice of local
            authorities and monitor local media.
            Road travel

            The road network is excellent. Some roads may be closed in winter, particularly in
            northern areas. Consult local news and weather reports prior to travel.
            Public transportation

            Taxis are available. Public transportation is convenient, reliable and punctual. Modern
            trains operate throughout the country. Extensive and efficient ferry services operate
            between Sweden and other countries in the Baltic Sea.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            General safety information

            Exercise normal safety precautions. Ensure that your personal belongings and passports
            and other travel documents are secure at all times.

            Crime

            Petty crime has increased and occurs in most public areas, particularly in Berne, Zurich
            and Geneva. Pickpockets are active in public places, such as airports and railway
            stations. Exercise caution on trains, especially on overnight trips to neighbouring
            countries.

            Thieves often operate in tandem, with one distracting the traveller while another
            snatches any valuables.

            Never leave bags containing money, airline tickets, credit cards or passports in the
            trunk of a parked car and do not leave anything on car seats.
            Alertswiss portal

            The alertswiss portal (in French only) gathers essential information regarding disaster
            preparedness and emergency situations in Switzerland and provides guidance on how to
            behave. Exercise caution, follow the advice of local authorities and monitor local
            media.
            Road travel

            Although many roads are mountainous and winding, road conditions and safety standards
            are very good. In winter, snow tires are required and snow chains may be required as
            well in some mountain areas.
            Demonstrations

            Demonstrations occur periodically throughout the country. Avoid all demonstrations,
            follow the advice of local authorities and monitor local media.
            Public transportation

            Public transportation is excellent.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            Mountain activities

            If you intend to do mountaineering or ski touring:

            a) never practice these activities alone;
            b) always hire an experienced guide from a reputable company;
            c) buy travel health insurance that includes helicopter rescue and medical evacuation;
            d) ensure you are in top physical condition;
            e) advise a family member or friend of your itinerary and when you expect to be back;
            f) know the symptoms of acute altitude sickness, which can be fatal;
            g) register with the Embassy of Canada in Switzerland; and
            h) obtain detailed information on trekking routes or ski slopes before setting out.

            Special avalanche beacons can be purchased or rented to help searchers locate buried
            victims.

            You are advised to visit the Switzerland Tourism website for information on weather and
            safety conditions.

            Terrorism

            The security situation in Syria is very volatile, and violence associated with the
            conflict is ongoing. The threat of terrorism in Syria from extremist groups such as ISIL
            and Jabat Al Nusra is generalized. Car bombings and other violent incidents occur
            regularly, killing and injuring many civilians.

            Maintain a high level of personal security awareness at all times, as terrorist
            incidents occur with no warning. Exercise appropriate caution in crowded places,
            including pedestrian promenades, shopping malls, open markets and restaurants. Monitor
            local news reports and follow the advice of local authorities.
            Kidnapping

            Although kidnappings had already increased throughout Syria, since the beginning of
            civil unrest in March 2011, 2014 saw a sharp increase in the kidnapping of
            non-government organization workers and journalists. Kidnappings are common in various
            parts of the country, including in parts of Aleppo and Damascus.

            Kidnapping for ransom is common, as are politically motivated kidnappings by armed and
            terrorist groups that often result in execution.

            If you remain in Syria despite this warning, you should be extremely vigilant when
            travelling, especially after dark.
            Crime

            The crime rate has increased in Syria. Exercise a high degree of caution. Ensure
            personal belongings and passports and other travel documents are in a secure place.
            Women’s safety

            There have been incidents of women being harassed. Consult our publication entitled Her
            Own Way: A Woman’s Safe-Travel Guide for travel safety information for Canadian women.

            Women in ISIL-controlled territory, such as Raqqah, are at extreme risk of being
            physically harmed.
            Transportation

            Aggressive drivers and poor driving standards make road travel hazardous. Avoid driving
            outside of major cities after dark. Pedestrians should remain vigilant.

            Roadblocks and checkpoints have been set up on roads, including major roads and highways
            in and around Damascus, Aleppo and other major cities, as well as along the
            Damascus-Aleppo, Damascus-Jordan and Damascus-Beirut highways. Road travel restrictions
            may be imposed without notice, making travel slow and dangerous. Some border crossings
            are no longer under the control of Syrian authorities; instead, they are in the hands of
            opposition groups, including extremists.

            Use only officially marked taxis.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            General safety information

            Telecommunication services and road access to and within some cities may be disrupted
            due to security operations.

            Journalists attempting to operate in Syria without official approval from the Syrian
            government place themselves at considerable personal risk. Foreign journalists are being
            particularly scrutinized by Syrian authorities. Journalists and other foreigners in
            opposition-held areas may be harmed, kidnapped or killed by the armed groups operating
            there. A number of foreign journalists have already been killed, and others have been
            detained by Syrian armed forces and by other armed groups.

            Syrians and foreigners alike can be arbitrarily arrested and detained, and obtaining
            consular access or information on these cases is extremely difficult. Foreigners,
            including Canadians, detained in Syria for any reason, cannot assume that Syrian
            authorities will help them contact their government.

            Carry identification documents at all times. Carry a photocopy of your passport and
            leave another one with a relative or friend at home.

            Crime

            The crime rate is relatively low. Petty crime (such as pickpocketing and purse
            snatching) occurs, usually at airports and train stations, on public transportation, and
            in main tourist shopping areas, hotel lobbies, and crowded streets. Bags left unattended
            are likely to be stolen. Ensure that your personal belongings, passports and other
            travel documents are secure at all times.

            Women should exercise caution at all times and should avoid travelling alone in taxis at
            night when possible. Consult our publication entitled Her Own Way: A Woman’s Safe-Travel
            Guide for travel safety information specifically aimed at Canadian women.
            Demonstrations

            Strikes and demonstrations occur from time to time on short notice. Exercise caution,
            avoid areas where demonstrations are being held and avoid confrontations with
            protestors.
            Transportation

            Traffic congestion is severe in urban areas.

            Driving habits in Taiwan are often more erratic and reckless than in Canada. Driving or
            riding motorcycles is dangerous and should be avoided, even by experienced
            motorcyclists. Mountain roads are narrow, winding, and poorly banked. Substandard road
            conditions and local disregard for traffic laws result in frequent accidents. Several
            foreigners have been involved in accidents that caused serious and even fatal injuries.
            Motorcycles and scooters weave in and out of traffic. Pedestrians should always exercise
            caution when crossing the road. Be aware of your surroundings at all times if you plan
            to drive a vehicle in Taiwan.

            As taxi drivers tend to speak little or no English or French, you should have your
            destination written in Chinese.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            Emergency services

            Dial 110 to reach police and 119 for ambulance and fire fighters.

            Areas bordering Afghanistan, the Kyrgyz Republic and Uzbekistan (see Advisory)

            The security situation along the border with Afghanistan remains unstable, as this area
            is used as a transit point for drugs and other forms of illegal trafficking.

            Marked and unmarked minefields are present in areas bordering Afghanistan, the Kyrgyz
            Republic and Uzbekistan. Exercise a high level of caution when travelling to these
            areas.
            Gorno-Badakhshan (see Advisory)

            Tajik security forces have periodically conducted operations in Khorough since July
            2012. Communications in the area may be affected by these operations. Should security
            operations begin, you should leave the area immediately, if it is safe to do so. You
            should also register online with the Registration of Canadians Abroad service in order
            to receive the latest advice from the Canadian embassy in Astana, Kazakhstan.
            Terrorism

            Although there has not been a terrorist incident in Tajikistan since 2010, you should
            exercise a high degree of caution, regularly review your security practices and remain
            aware of the security situation in the country.
            Crime

            While the security situation in Tajikistan, including in Dushanbe, is generally stable,
            there has been a rise in criminal activities.

            The pickpocketing and mugging of foreigners occur. Do not show signs of affluence or
            carry large sums of money. Exercise caution, particularly in tourist areas, commercial
            and public establishments frequented by foreigners (e.g. hotels, clubs, restaurants,
            bars, schools and places of worship) and at outdoor recreation events. You should be
            particularly vigilant in crowded public places such as markets.
            Women’s safety

            There have been a number of reports of harassment of women. Travel in groups and in
            daylight. Please consult Her Own Way: A Woman’s Guide to Safe and Successful Travel for
            more information.
            Demonstrations

            Demonstrations concerning Tajikistan’s difficult economic situation may occur. Avoid all
            demonstrations and large gatherings, follow the advice of local authorities and monitor
            local media.
            Regional travel

            Exercise caution in the Rasht (or Karategin) Valley and its Tavildara district, as
            tensions may still exist following the 2010 clashes between Tajik security forces and
            militant groups.
            Border areas

            Some border crossings, especially in the Fergana Valley, which extends across eastern
            Uzbekistan, the Kyrgyz Republic, and Tajikistan, are not well defined and are very
            porous.

            Neighbouring countries may close their borders unilaterally.
            Transportation

            Rail service is unreliable and underdeveloped.

            Air travel is limited. In winter, poor weather conditions commonly cause sudden flight
            delays and cancellations. Reservations on regional airlines are not always honoured.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            General safety information

            There are numerous checkpoints, and security forces may fire at vehicles that do not
            stop. Exercise caution when travelling east of Dushanbe, as armed groups have
            established checkpoints and target foreigners.

            Carry a photocopy of your visa and passport with you at all times. Keep your original
            documents in safekeeping facilities. Leave a photocopy of your travel documents with a
            relative or friend at home.

            Tourist facilities are very limited.

            Energy, water and food shortages are common throughout Tajikistan, especially in winter
            and spring.

            Blackouts and brownouts occur frequently.

            Maintain a stock of emergency items at your hotel/residence. If you intend to remain in
            Tajikistan for extended periods, prepare and review personal emergency plans with your
            family.
            Emergency services

            Dial 01 for fire, 02 for the police and 03 for an ambulance.

            Sectarian violence

            In recent years, Tanzania has seen a slight increase in sectarian violence between
            Christians and Muslims, including in places of worship. Take this information into
            consideration when planning your trip.
            Terrorism

            Regional terror groups, including those associated with al Qaeda and al-Shabaab,
            continue to threaten Western interests and other potential targets in Tanzania. The
            September 21, 2013 attack on an upscale Nairobi mall illustrates the threat of attacks
            on civilians in East Africa.

            On February 23-24, 2014, three explosions were reported in Zanzibar. They occurred
            outside the Tanzania Assemblies of God Church, at the entrance of the Anglican Church
            compound and in a popular restaurant in Stone Town. Further attacks cannot be ruled out.

            Explosions reportedly killed three people and injured many more at a political rally in
            Arusha on June 15, 2013. On April 13, 2014, an explosion in a bar in Arusha injured 15
            people.

            Be vigilant in crowded places and monitor local media.
            Crime

            Violent crime has increased throughout the country, both in the country and in main
            cities. Exercise a high degree of caution, especially in Dar es Salaam and Zanzibar, and
            in public places such as hotels, restaurants, nightclubs, cinemas and shopping centres.
            Muggings, attacks and hold-ups occur occasionally in Dar es Salaam, Stone Town and in
            the immediate vicinity of the coastal resorts on Unguja. You should be vigilant,
            particularly in Stone Town after dark. Avoid deserted beaches.

            In Dar es Salaam, particular caution is warranted on Toure Drive (Msasani Peninsula)
            where muggings and attacks, including attacks on moving vehicles, have recently been
            reported.

            Petty crime is prevalent. Muggings, pickpocketing and theft are common in crowded areas,
            on public transportation and on public beaches.

            Sexual assaults involving tourists have been reported.

            An increasing number of Canadians have reported being taken to automated banking
            machines (ABMs) and forced to withdraw funds from their account after accepting a ride
            from a stranger, a local taxi or a recent acquaintance. Incidents are most often
            reported at ferry, bus and train terminals in Dar es Salaam. Use only licensed taxis
            selected by a reputable hotel or restaurant, or one located at an official taxi stand.
            Always ask for identification before accepting transportation and check that the
            driver\'s ID matches the name of the car registration and taxi license. Avoid taking a
            taxi that has been hailed for you by a recent acquaintance. Instead, hail your own taxi.
            A licensed taxi is a white car with a white (never yellow) license plate, a colored
            stripe running laterally on the side panels of the vehicle, and a number inside a circle
            on both passenger doors.

            Armed robbery, although rare, can also occur in parks and nature reserves, including the
            northern circuit in the vicinity of Serengeti National Park, Ngogongoro and Arusha
            National Parks, and regions surrounding Mount Kilimanjaro. Organized tours and
            independent travellers have been targeted. You should only travel with a reputable tour
            company (hotels can make recommendations). Avoid camping or travelling alone.

            Remain on tourist routes and avoid remote areas. Exercise caution in and around Arusha,
            where armed robberies and carjackings have been reported. Should you find yourself on
            less-travelled roads and trails, avoid stopping since armed robberies and carjackings
            may occur. Keep doors locked and windows up at all times and do not pick up strangers.
            Travel in a convoy between cities, and avoid travelling after dark.

            Travel near refugee camps in the northwestern area bordering the Democratic Republic of
            Congo, Rwanda and Burundi (in the region of Kigoma and to the west of Kagera) is
            dangerous due to banditry.
            Demonstrations

            Demonstrations occur and have the potential to suddenly turn violent. Canadians should
            avoid all large gatherings and demonstrations, follow the advice of local authorities
            and monitor local media.
            Corruption

            Be careful when going through Customs at airports, as officials have been known to
            solicit bribes. In a common scheme, an official will ask the visitor to produce a
            certificate of proof of inoculation against yellow fever, even though a yellow fever
            certificate is only required if arriving from a country where yellow fever is endemic.
            If such a scheme occurs, you may request to speak to a senior official. However, if this
            does not work, be patient and negotiate with the official.

            You may be approached by police officers requesting money for alleged offences. We
            recommend that you insist on proper identification before proceeding to a police
            station. You may also inform the police officers that you will contact the High
            Commission for advice. This tends to dissuade them from soliciting bribes. Report all
            such incidents to the High Commission of Canada in Dar es Salaam.
            Road travel

            Traffic drives on the left. Road conditions are poor and road signs are often missing.
            For travel outside main cities, use a four-wheel-drive vehicle. Excessive speeds,
            driving habits, poor lighting, lack of vehicle maintenance, roaming wildlife and
            livestock, cyclists and pedestrians pose risks. Travel by road at night should be
            avoided. Within cities, travel with licensed taxis and ask for identification. Avoid
            driving unless you are familiar with local conditions.
            Other transportation

            Bus travel is not recommended, as bus accidents often result in fatalities. Rail service
            is limited, uncomfortable, and unreliable.

            Use only licensed taxis selected by a reputable hotel or restaurant, or one located at
            an official taxi stand (see Crime section above).
            Ferries

            While there are regular ferries travelling between Dar es Salaam and Zanzibar, Tanzania
            ports are often frequented by persuasive ticket scalpers. Passengers should only use
            reputable ferry companies, as two local ferries with foreign national passengers have
            capsized in 2012. If you believe a ferry to be overloaded or unsafe, refrain from
            boarding and make alternative travel arrangements. Vessels travelling between
            Zanzibar/Pemba, Tanga/Pemba and Mafia/Mainland Tanzania are reported to be less reliable
            and often overcrowded.
            Air travel

            Domestic flights may be subject to delays and cancellations.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            Piracy

            Pirate attacks occur in coastal waters, and in some cases, further out at sea. Mariners
            should take appropriate precautions. For additional information, consult the Live Piracy
            Report published by the International Maritime Bureau.
            General safety information

            Leave personal belongings, including cash, passports and airline tickets, in a hotel
            safe or other secure location.

            Avoid walking after dark. Do not accept food or drink from strangers as they may be
            drugged.

            Seek local advice on the security situation prior to visiting beaches.

            Tourist facilities are adequate in major cities but limited in remote areas, with the
            exception of principal game lodges and beach resorts.

            Wild animals can be dangerous. When visiting parks or nature reserves, follow the advice
            and warnings of local tour guides.

            If you are considering climbing Mount Kilimanjaro, carefully consider the inherent risks
            involved, primarily altitude sickness and hypothermia. It is important to investigate
            the numerous tour operators in order to find a reputable guide. Each year people are
            seriously injured or killed on the mountain and emergency assistance is severely
            limited.

            Due to power shortages, power cuts may occur on a daily basis. Travellers should expect
            occasional disruptions in power, as not all businesses are equipped with a generator.
            Emergency services

            In an emergency, dial 112 for police.

            Political tensions and demonstrations

            Political instability in Thailand has created a volatile and unpredictable security
            environment, which has persisted throughout the country, particularly in the capital,
            Bangkok, since November 2013. Political demonstrations could take place at any time in
            Bangkok and in other parts of the country, including Phuket, Chiang Mai, and Surat
            Thani.

            On May 22, 2014, the Royal Thai Army took control of the administration of the country
            in a coup d’état. Martial law has been instituted throughout Thailand, granting
            additional powers to security forces, including the right to prevent public gatherings,
            censor media, impose curfews, set up checkpoints, restrict movement, search for weapons
            and exercise force in response to violence. Such additional measures could be enforced
            at any time. There is an increased military presence throughout the country and
            gatherings of more than five people are prohibited.

            A number of television and radio stations are unavailable or are not broadcasting and
            access to social media services may be temporarily interrupted; however, Internet and
            phone services, as well as airports and public transportation, are operating normally.

            Sporadic pro- and anti-coup demonstrations occur. Demonstration sites include the
            Victory Monument area, the Democracy Monument area, and Ratchraprasong intersection in
            central Bangkok. Other areas of the city may also be affected by protests and associated
            movements. Demonstrations may cause traffic and public transportation disruptions due to
            the blocking of major roads and intersections and closures of BTS stations.

            Violence associated with demonstrations has occasionally intensified. Several incidents
            have resulted in deaths and injuries. Indiscriminate attacks using explosive devices and
            firearms have taken place in busy public areas during the day and at night. Clashes have
            also occurred between pro- and anti-government demonstrators. On occasion, police have
            responded with tear gas, water cannons and rubber bullets in their attempts to deter
            protesters. Attacks do not specifically target tourists or foreigners, but the danger of
            being in the wrong place at the wrong time is always present.

            Maintain a high level of personal security awareness at all times. Carefully plan your
            movements throughout Bangkok, allowing for extra commuting time (including to the
            airport) and identify alternate routes in case of blockages. Avoid demonstrations sites
            and surrounding areas, as well as military installations and concentrations of security
            personnel. Be aware that any public statement that is perceived to be critical of the
            political situation in Thailand, the National Council for Peace and Order, the Royal
            Thai Army, or the Monarchy could lead to detention. Follow the advice of local
            authorities and remain informed of current events by monitoring available media,
            including social media.
            Preah Vihear temple area and surrounding border region (see Advisory)

            There have been frequent clashes between Thailand and Cambodia over a border dispute in
            this region, including exchanges of gunfire and artillery, which resulted in numerous
            fatalities and the evacuation of civilians. Martial law is in effect in the area and the
            presence of landmines has been reported. Tensions are high and military hostilities
            could further escalate without warning. Exercise a high degree of caution if you are
            travelling to all other areas of the Thai-Cambodian border.
            Southern provinces of Narathiwat, Pattani, Yala and Songkhla (see Advisory)

            Violence in the Muslim-majority southernmost provinces of Narathiwat, Pattani, Yala and
            Songkhla is highly unpredictable. Attacks against military and civilian targets occur
            almost daily, and include shootings, bombings, beheadings and arson. Westerners may be
            specifically targeted. Deadly attacks occur frequently and are regularly directed at
            government and security buildings and personnel, but have also occurred in a variety of
            public places, including shopping districts, entertainment venues, public transit and
            hotels that may be frequented by tourists. Since January 2004, more than 4,700 people
            have been killed and many more injured, including foreigners. You risk becoming victim
            of an indiscriminate attack if you travel in the region.

            Heavily enhanced security measures—including martial law in the provinces of Narathiwat,
            Pattani and Yala, as well as the Sadao district of Songkhla—are in place to provide
            authorities with increased enforcement powers that may be used to address ongoing
            violence in the region. These measures allow authorities to detain suspects without
            charge, conduct searches, seize objects or documents, and impose curfews.
            Border areas in the provinces of Tak and Mae Hong Son (border with Burma)

            Be particularly vigilant when travelling to the border areas in the Thai provinces of
            Tak and Mae Hong Son due to banditry and occasional armed clashes on the Burmese side of
            the border, and between Thai security forces and armed criminal groups, such as drug
            traffickers. Incursions and shelling into Thailand have occurred. Border crossing points
            may be closed without notice.
            Terrorism

            There is a threat of terrorism throughout Southeast Asia, including Thailand. Maintain a
            high level of personal security awareness at all times as the security situation could
            deteriorate without notice. Exercise caution, particularly in commercial and public
            establishments (hotels, clubs, restaurants, bars, schools, places of worship), outdoor
            recreation events and tourist areas frequented by foreigners.

            On April 10, 2015, a car bomb exploded in the underground parking lot of the Central
            Festival shopping centre on the island of Koh Samui, injuring seven people. On February
            1, 2015, two explosions occurred at the Siam station of Bangkok’s Skytrain system,
            outside a shopping mall. One person was injured as a result of these explosions.
            Crime

            Violent crime against foreigners occurs occasionally. Petty crime, such as purse
            snatching, pickpocketing and theft, is common. Do not leave bags unattended. Ensure that
            your personal belongings, passports and other travel documents are secure at all times,
            especially in tourist areas, crowded markets, and bus or train stations. Thieves
            sometimes use razors to slit open purses or bags to remove the contents. Use only
            reputable transportation companies. Thefts have been reported on the buses and vans that
            provide transport services throughout the country. Personal belongings, including
            passports, have been stolen from luggage compartments under buses, especially on long
            distance journeys. Break-ins occur at budget guesthouses, sometimes while guests are
            asleep in their rooms.

            Be careful at night in entertainment areas throughout the country, particularly during
            Full Moon parties in Koh Phangan and similar events in other popular tourist locations.
            Robberies, injuries, drug abuse, arrests, assaults (including sexual assaults) and
            deaths related to these parties have been reported. Passport thefts and losses are
            extremely common at these parties and their replacement may cause significant travel
            delays.

            Foreigners have been targeted in incidents of drink spiking, often combined with sexual
            assault or theft. Never leave food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers, and
            pay attention when drinks are being prepared and served. Seek immediate medical
            attention if you suspect that you have been drugged.

            Exercise caution when travelling to the border areas with Burma (Myanmar). Occasional
            violence, banditry and clashes between government forces, rebel units, and drug
            traffickers have been reported. Consult the Thai Tourist Police, by calling 1155
            toll-free, to determine if official border crossing points are open. Cross at designated
            border crossing points only, with the required travel documentation.
            Women’s safety

            Sexual assaults against foreign women have occurred. Consult our publication entitled
            Her Own Way: A Woman’s Safe-Travel Guide for travel safety information specifically
            aimed at Canadian women.
            General safety information

            We have received reports that there have been recent cases of poisoning linked to
            chemical pesticides, including phosphine. Should you believe you have been exposed to a
            chemical pesticide and are experiencing unusual symptoms, seek immediate medical
            assistance. When travelling, seek information on whether or not chemical pesticides,
            such as phosphine are used in your accommodations.

            Always carry your passport and visa as you may be asked to prove your identity and date
            of entry into the country. Failure to provide internationally recognized identification
            could result in detention.
            Transportation

            Traffic drives on the left. Paved roads connect major cities, but most have only two
            lanes. Motorcycle accidents kill or maim Canadians in Thailand each year. You should
            avoid driving or riding motorcycles in Thailand, even if you are an experienced
            motorcyclist. Substandard road conditions, local disregard for traffic laws, and drunk
            driving result in frequent accidents, particularly in the areas of Bangkok, Pattaya,
            Phuket and Koh Samui. Although motorcycles can easily be rented in Thailand, it is
            illegal to operate them without a valid Thai motorcycle licence or an international
            driving permit with a motorcycle endorsement. Helmets are mandatory for motorcycle
            drivers and passengers, but many do not meet international safety standards. Carry your
            identification card, driver’s licence and vehicle registration book at all times.

            Private vehicle, minivan and bus accidents caused by dangerous road conditions, poor
            weather, driver fatigue, dangerous driving practices and driver intoxication are common.
            Canadians have been injured or killed in such accidents. Slow-moving trucks limit speed
            and visibility. Speeding and reckless passing are common. Avoid driving on mountain
            roads at night, especially during the rainy season (June-October).

            When arriving by air, use licensed taxis from official taxi stands, limousine services
            or official airport buses, or arrange to be picked up by hotel shuttle services.
            Unlicensed vehicles (black and white licence plates) are not properly insured to carry
            passengers and may not use meters. Do not share a taxi with strangers. Disputes with
            operators of taxis, tuk tuks, etc., have occurred and have occasionally resulted in
            violence or intimidation. Seek the assistance of local police in settling the matter if
            this happens to you and you feel threatened.

            There have been several incidents of passenger boats sinking due to overcrowding and
            poor maintenance. Vessels often lack adequate safety equipment. Rail lines in the far
            south have been the target of acts of sabotage and armed attack.

            A number of train accidents have occurred in the past few years, some causing injuries
            and deaths.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            Scams

            Canadians visiting Thailand regularly report having fallen victim to a variety of scams.
            Before renting a motorcycle or jet-ski, read all rental contracts thoroughly to ensure
            that the vehicle is insured to cover damage and theft. Only rent from reputable
            companies and never leave your passport as collateral. It has been reported that, upon
            return of the rental, claims of damage allegedly caused by the renter have been made. In
            some cases, renters who refused to pay were harassed and threatened, and their passports
            (left as collateral) were held. If your passport is inaccessible because of such a
            situation, you may be subject to investigation by Passport Canada and may receive
            limited passport services. In other cases, particularly with jet-skis, accidents have
            been allegedly staged to create damage for which the rental company seeks compensation
            from the renter. In cases of motorcycle rentals, some companies have been known to steal
            the motorcycle and claim compensation from the renter for the loss.

            When dealing with travel agencies, ensure that the company is a reputable tour
            organization before providing payment. Disputes may be reported to the Tourism Authority
            of Thailand by calling 1672.

            In known scams involving gems and jewellery, merchants sell lower-quality items at
            inflated prices with promises that the items can be resold at a profit. The guarantees
            that merchants offer are not always honoured. Carefully consider all purchases if you
            are not knowledgeable about gems and jewellery. The Government of Canada cannot assist
            in obtaining refunds for purchases made. For further information, contact the Tourism
            Authority of Thailand.

            Report all incidents of crime or scams to the Thai police in the jurisdiction where the
            incident occurred, and before leaving Thailand. Contact the Tourist Police and the
            Tourist Assistance Centre by calling 1155 toll-free.
            Swimming and water sports

            Deaths have occurred as a result of contact with poisonous sea jellies. There have been
            reports of sea jellies off Koh Pha-ngan, Phuket, Krabi, Koh Lanta and Koh Phi Phi.
            Exercise extreme caution when swimming in these areas. If stung, seek immediate medical
            attention.

            Riptides in coastal areas can be strong, including the popular destinations of Phuket,
            Koh Samui, Pattaya, Rayong and Cha-am/Hua Hin. There have been a number of deaths due to
            drowning. Heed flag warnings and under no circumstances swim when a red flag is
            displayed.

            Diving schools and rescue services may not adhere to international standards. Rent water
            sports equipment only from operators affiliated with major international training
            organizations.
            Piracy

            Pirate attacks occur in coastal waters and, in some cases, farther out at sea. Mariners
            should take appropriate precautions. For additional information, consult the Live Piracy
            Report published by the International Maritime Bureau.

            Civil unrest and demonstrations

            Outbreaks of civil unrest have occurred in 2006 and 2008. Although the situation is
            currently generally calm, political tensions remain and violent episodes could occur
            with little notice.

            Avoid all demonstrations and large gatherings, and stay away from areas where they might
            occur. Protests can turn violent without warning and a gathering, regardless of its
            size, may become a target for a terrorist threat or attack. Demonstrations are likely to
            occur in the vicinity of government buildings, institutions or residences. Violence can
            occur during significant political events, such as presidential or parliamentary
            elections. Be particularly cautious in the periods leading up to, during and following
            these types of events.

            Violence and demonstrations may affect transportation routes and land border crossings,
            as well as flights in and out of Dili’s airport. Disturbances have occurred in the
            vicinity of Dili’s Comoro airport, areas surrounding the camps of internally displaced
            persons and at food storage warehouses.
            Crime

            Gang-related violence, arson, robbery and vandalism occur, especially in Dili. Gangs in
            Dili have attacked cars with stones and darts fired from slingshots, particularly during
            the early evening hours and at night. Avoid armed non-government groups, including
            martial arts groups, throughout the country.

            Petty crime such as mugging, pickpocketing and purse snatching also occurs, and
            foreigners are frequently targeted by thieves. Do not show signs of affluence, remain
            vigilant and ensure that your personal belongings, passports and all other travel
            documents are secure.
            Women’s safety

            Sexual harassment and violence against women occur. Consult our publication entitled Her
            Own Way: A Woman’s Safe-Travel Guide for travel safety information specifically aimed at
            Canadian women.
            Transportation

            Do not travel alone, especially after dark or in secluded areas. Avoid unnecessary local
            travel. Local taxis should not be used. Public transportation services do not meet
            international safety standards.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.

            Traffic drives on the left. Driving conditions can be hazardous. Roads are poorly
            maintained, lack adequate lighting, and those outside of Dili are often unpaved. Serious
            accidents are frequent and travelling by road at night should be avoided. Frequent
            roadblocks occur. All motor vehicles must be registered with the Motor Vehicle Office.
            General safety information

            Facilities and services such as hotels, restaurants and public transportation are
            available in Dili but are very limited or non-existent elsewhere on the island.
            International calls are possible only from Dili and several districts close to the
            capital. Internet access and mobile telephone coverage is available in Dili but is
            limited elsewhere. Government services are also limited.

            Exercise extreme caution at bars and nightclubs as altercations between groups may occur
            at a variety of venues.

            Unexploded ordnance is regularly found in open areas outside Dili. Be careful when
            trekking in rural areas.

            Military operations may take place at any time throughout the country. Remain vigilant
            at all times. If you encounter a military operation, leave the area immediately. Follow
            the advice of local authorities and maintain a high level of personal security
            awareness.

            You are encouraged to register with the Embassy of Australia in Dili in order to receive
            the latest information on situations and events that could affect your safety.
            Piracy

            Pirate attacks occur in coastal waters and, in some cases, farther out at sea. Mariners
            should take appropriate precautions. For additional information, consult the Live Piracy
            Report published by the International Maritime Bureau.
            Emergency services

            Dial 112 or +670 723 0365. You may also call these numbers for information on the
            current security situation.

            Crime

            The rise in crime is a serious concern in urban areas, including in Lomé. Several
            attacks, armed assaults, including machete attacks and violent robberies have been
            reported in the past months. Exercise extreme vigilance and caution as a new scheme of
            armed carjackings and residential burglaries targeting foreigners is on the increase.

            Crimes of opportunity such as petty thefts and muggings are prevalent. Thieves are
            active in Lomé, particularly along beaches and in market areas. You should not show
            signs of affluence and avoid walking alone, especially after dark.

            There have been incidents of illegal roadblocks set up by armed bandits who stop and rob
            vehicles. Attacks have been reported near the Burkina Faso border and have occurred
            mostly after dark.
            Elections and demonstrations

            Political demonstrations occur frequently, especially in Lomé, and can turn violent with
            little warning. Presidential elections are scheduled to take place on April 25, 2015.
            Demonstrations may take place in the period surrounding the elections. Avoid
            demonstrations and large gatherings, monitor local media and follow the advice of local
            authorities.
            Road travel

            Urban roads are usually paved, but small motorcycles, poorly maintained and erratically
            driven vehicles, pedestrians and roaming animals pose risks. Road signs are often poorly
            visible or completely missing. Heavy seasonal rains and flooding could affect local road
            conditions.

            Overland travel after dark should be avoided. In Lomé, beware of individuals who appear
            to need assistance, as bandits frequently use this tactic to lure drivers out of their
            vehicles. You should keep vehicle doors locked and windows shut at all times. In case of
            a road accident, you should call the police and do not try to leave the scene as it will
            draw a crowd that can turn hostile. In remote areas, travel in a convoy of at least two
            vehicles. Since emergency vehicle services are non-existent, in the event of an
            accident, you should proceed to the nearest police station or hospital. A
            four-wheel-drive vehicle is recommended for travel off the main roads.

            Identification papers and vehicle documentation should be readily available for frequent
            police checkpoints.
            Public transportation

            Exercise caution when using public transportation. Taxis are available, but some are
            poorly maintained. You should not share taxis with strangers. Motorcycles and mopeds
            also operate as taxis and are common, especially in Lomé.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            Piracy

            Pirate attacks occur in coastal waters and, in some cases, farther out at sea. Mariners
            should take appropriate precautions. For additional information, consult the Live Piracy
            Report published by the International Maritime Bureau.
            Fraud

            Cases of attempted fraud are frequently reported in this country. See our Overseas Fraud
            page for more information on scams abroad.
            General safety information

            Tourist facilities are limited and may be affected by chronic power shortages.

            You should carry certified copies of identification and travel documents at all times
            and keep originals in a safe place, for example, in a hotel safe. It is also advisable
            to carry a cellular phone.

            Ocean currents are very strong along the coast. Many drownings occur each year.

            The decision to travel is your responsibility. You are also responsible for your
            personal safety abroad. The purpose of this Travel Advice is to provide up-to-date
            information to enable you to make well-informed decisions.

            Most Canadian visitors to Tokelau do not experience problems.

            Tourist facilities are limited. Basic infrastructure services such as electricity and
            telephones are minimal.

            There is a limited supply of fresh water. Although bottles of water are readily
            available in village stores, you should bring your own water or a supply of water
            purification tablets.

            There are no airports or automobiles.

            Crime

            Petty crime occurs. An increase in theft, including house break-ins, has been reported.
            Ensure that your personal belongings, passports and other travel documents are secure at
            all times. The incidence of crime increases after dark.
            Women’s safety

            Some cases of sexual assault targeting foreigners have occurred. Women should avoid
            isolated areas, especially at night. Consult our publication entitled Her Own Way: A
            Woman’s Safe-Travel Guide for travel safety information specifically aimed at Canadian
            women.
            Demonstrations

            Demonstrations may occur and have the potential to turn violent suddenly. They can lead
            to significant disruptions to traffic and public transportation. Avoid all
            demonstrations and large gatherings, follow the advice of local authorities and monitor
            local media.
            Transportation

            Traffic drives on the left. Driving can be hazardous due to poor road conditions and
            lack of adequate lighting for night-time driving. Roads in Nuku’alofa are paved, but
            most other roads are not.

            Inter-island ferries do not always meet international safety standards. You should
            verify the credentials of the operator and the state of the vessel’s safety equipment.

            Internal air service can be unpredictable. Flights are often cancelled on short notice.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            General safety information

            You are encouraged to register with the High Commission of Australia in Nuku\'alofa in
            order to receive the latest information on situations and events that could affect your
            safety.

            Exercise caution when swimming as dangerous currents exist.

            Basic tourist facilities and services are available in Nuku\'alofa but limited
            elsewhere.

            Crime

            Violent robberies, assaults and rape occur frequently. Cruise ship passengers should
            take particular care when walking around the docks in Port of Spain. Gang and
            drug-related violence, including shootings and kidnappings, occurs and can affect
            bystanders. Crimes of opportunity such as petty theft tend to increase during the annual
            Trinidad Carnival in February or March and during the Christmas holidays.

            Remain highly vigilant in Laventille and at popular tourist sites such as Fort George,
            La Brea (Pitch Lake) and Las Cuevas beach, where crimes targeting foreigners have been
            reported. Incidents of gangs following cars leaving Trinidad\'s Piarco International
            Airport and robbing travellers once they reach their destination have been reported.
            Avoid unpopulated areas such as scenic overlooks, especially after dark.

            Avoid visiting isolated and unpatrolled beaches due to the risk of crime. On certain
            beaches, security is provided from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. only.

            Tourists and foreign nationals are also victims of crime in Tobago. Maintain a high
            level of vigilance and personal security awareness at all times. Avoid visiting isolated
            and unpatrolled beaches due to the risk of crime, even in daylight. Ensure that your
            personal belongings and travel documents are secure at all times. Do not carry large
            amounts of cash or show signs of affluence. If possible, stay in hotels or villas in
            gated communities with guards and cameras.

            Home invasions are common. If you are staying in either private or commercial
            accommodations, you should be aware of your surroundings at all times and ensure that
            windows and doors are securely locked.
            Demonstrations and civil unrest

            Sporadic demonstrations and work-related strikes may cause significant disturbances
            throughout the country. Avoid large crowds and demonstrations and monitor local news
            reports for current information.
            Road travel

            Traffic drives on the left. Most vehicles are right-hand-drive, but left-hand-drive
            vehicles are permitted.

            Road conditions are good on highways in Trinidad, but less so on secondary roads,
            particularly in the mountainous northern region. Rural roads are generally narrow, in
            poor repair and often congested. If possible, avoid travel outside Port of Spain or San
            Fernando after dark, especially the Beetham Highway. Drive with windows closed and doors
            locked, since thefts can occur at traffic lights or in slow-moving traffic. Report
            traffic accidents to the nearest police station.
            Public transportation

            There is an extensive public transportation system of taxis, maxi-taxis (vans) and
            larger buses.

            Taxi services from hotels are more expensive than public or route taxis. Route taxis
            will often stop at any point along the road to pick up or drop off passengers. The
            airport is served by the Airport Taxi Drivers\' Cooperative. Negotiate fares before
            departure. Take registered taxis after dark.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            Emergency services

            Mount Chaambi National Park and Tunisia’s Greater South (see Advisory)

            There is an increased threat of kidnapping and terrorism in the area of the Mount
            Chaambi National Park. Military operations against suspected terrorists have been
            ongoing in the regions of Kef, Jendouba and Kasserine, including Mount Chaambi, since
            the end of April 2013. The use of improvised explosive device has been reported in these
            areas.

            Exercise a high degree of caution when travelling the Goubellat-Dougga region in the
            governorate of Beja.

            You must inform the authorities if you plan to travel overland through the Sahara, and
            give a copy of your itinerary, including your point of departure, to the National Guard
            Post at Médenine. Such travel should be undertaken in a group accompanied by an
            experienced tour guide, a car equipped with features such as a global positioning system
            and adequate supplies. Due to the intense heat, travel in the Sahara during the months
            of July and August is not recommended.

            Exercise a high degree of caution, regularly review your security practices and remain
            alert to the changing situation.
            Demonstrations

            Tunisia is facing an increased risk of potentially violent demonstrations. Public order
            is regularly disrupted for various reasons, including political, social and economic
            tensions. These disruptions take the form of public protests, labour strikes, roadblocks
            and other disturbances that on many occasions have deteriorated into violent clashes
            between members of extremist movements, the police and/or civil society demonstrators,
            resulting in considerable property damage, injuries and deaths. There have been reports
            of members of extremist movements harassing foreigners.

            Exercise a high degree of caution, regularly review your security practices and remain
            alert to the changing situation, follow the advice of local authorities, avoid all
            confrontations, public gatherings and areas where unrest or other demonstrations could
            occur, since the situation could deteriorate suddenly.
            Increased threat of attacks and kidnappings

            In 2013, the French military assisted the Malian government in efforts to repel armed
            rebels. Terrorist groups in the region declared their intention to increase attacks and
            kidnappings targeting Westerners. While the United Nations peacekeeping mission in Mali
            has been supporting the transitional authorities in stabilizing the region since July
            2013, citizens of countries supporting the intervention are still at particular risk,
            but all travellers should exercise increased vigilance in the region.

            On September 21, 2014, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) released a
            statement threatening retaliation for the American -led coalition campaign against ISIL
            in Iraq and Syria. The statement encouraged opportunistic and indiscriminate attacks
            against citizens and interests of countries supporting the coalition, including
            Canadians. Individuals and terrorist groups in the region may be inspired to carry out
            attacks in a show of solidarity with ISIL. Canadians could also be targeted by a
            terrorist attack and be considered prime kidnapping targets. Exercise a high degree of
            personal security awareness at all times, maintain a heightened level of vigilance and
            be aware of your surroundings at all times.
            Terrorism and kidnappings

            There is a general threat of terrorism and kidnapping in Tunisia. Terrorist activity has
            increased in Tunisia over the past year. Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in
            places frequented by expatriates and foreign travellers. Maintain a high level of
            vigilance at all times.

            In the past year, a number of suspected terrorists and arms traffickers have been
            captured in various regions of the country, including the capital Tunis, indicating that
            extremist elements are present and that the instability in Libya and elsewhere in the
            Middle East and North Africa continues to pose a general threat to the security of
            foreigners, religious sites, foreign institutions and tourist facilities. On March 18,
            2015, an attack on the Tunisian parliament and the Bardo National Museum left more than
            20 dead, including many foreign tourists.

            Given the threat of terrorism and kidnappings, exercise increased caution, including
            near tourist facilities, and particularly in the Greater South (in all areas south of,
            and including, the towns of Nefta, Douz, Médenine and Zarzis), in areas near the border
            with Libya and Algeria, the Mount Chaambi National Park including the regions of Le Kef,
            Jendouba and Beja (see regional advisory). Regularly review your security practices and
            remain alert to the changing situation.
            Crime

            Reports of petty crime, including theft, pickpocketing, purse snatching and scams, are
            much more frequent since the revolution. Watch out for pickpockets in public places and
            tourist areas. Ensure personal belongings are secure and carry photocopies of
            identification documents and your passport at all times. Store originals in a safe
            place.
            Women’s safety

            Women travelling alone may be subject to certain forms of harassment and verbal abuse.
            Please consult our publication entitled Her Own Way: A Woman’s Guide to Safe and
            Successful Travel for safe travel advice specifically for women.
            Fraud

            Cases of young Tunisian men pursuing marriage with older Canadian women for financial
            gain or in order to gain entry to Canada have been reported in coastal resorts. See our
            Overseas Fraud page for more information on scams abroad.
            Borders

            Carefully plan any travel in the southern regions of Tunisia and along the Libyan and
            Algerian borders, as regional tensions increase the risk of terrorism or exposure to
            other disturbances.

            Remain vigilant because of the risk of crime, political demonstrations and road blocks
            in these regions, which have led to confrontations.

            While the borders with Algeria and Libya are open, they may close on short notice.
            Consult local authorities for the latest security information. We strongly encourage you
            to register through the Registration of Canadians Abroad service, monitor local news
            reports, stay well informed and consult the Travel Advice for these two countries prior
            to departure.
            Transportation

            Driving can be dangerous, particularly after dark. Traffic signs and signals are
            routinely ignored. Be especially cautious as cars rarely stop at pedestrian crosswalks
            or stoplights. Motorists sometimes drive on the wrong side of the road and ignore
            priority lanes. Bicycles, mopeds and motorcycles often operate without sufficient lights
            and reflectors, and regularly dart in and out of traffic. Pedestrians compound the
            problem by dodging traffic and ignoring vehicles. Police officers frequently stop cars
            for inspection, especially rental cars.

            Taxis are available but may be scarce in major cities at peak hours.

            Buses are crowded.

            Rail service is generally safe, fast and efficient. Petty crime occurs on city and
            inter-city trains. Be extremely cautious with your belongings at all times.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            Soccer games

            Avoid the crowds that can form at soccer matches as such events have sometimes led to
            incidents of violence.
            General safety information

            Despite the ongoing political transition, the security situation remains fragile. There
            has been a notable increase in the number of violent acts committed by extremists since
            early 2013. Although these excesses are widely condemned by the authorities, enforcing
            the law does not always seem possible, which makes it difficult at times to restore
            order.

            You should be accompanied by a guide on your travels or use a guide to help plan your
            travel.

            Border with Syria (see Advisory)

            Since mid-2013, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) has made substantial
            military gains in Syria along the Turkish border. As a result, extremist groups,
            including ISIL, are now targeting border crossings and other locations in Syria close to
            the Turkish border. These attacks are indiscriminate, often result in deaths and
            injuries and spill over into Turkey. Exercise extreme caution, review your security
            measures regularly and monitor these events very closely, as the security situation
            remains unpredictable.
            Southeast region

            The Turkish Armed Forces (TAF) carry out occasional air and ground strikes against
            Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) targets in the Turkish-Iraqi border area. TAF have
            established six temporary security zones in Hakkari, Siirt and Sirnak provinces, in
            which they strictly monitor and limit movement to prevent insurgent infiltration.

            Protests and civil unrest in several southeastern cities have led to violent clashes
            between police and protesters, with gunfire and small-scale bomb explosions that have
            resulted in deaths. Other incidents have also caused injuries and property damage.

            There is a risk, particularly to foreigners, of kidnapping in the area. Maintain a high
            level of vigilance at all times.

            Avoid overland travel. If you must undertake road travel, drive during the day and stay
            on major roads. Do not use public transportation.

            Avoid crossing the border with Iraq. The Government of Turkey tightly controls border
            traffic between the two countries.
            Terrorism

            On September 21, 2014, ISIL released a statement threatening retaliation for the
            American-led coalition campaign against ISIL in Iraq and Syria. The statement encouraged
            opportunistic and indiscriminate attacks against citizens and interests of countries
            supporting the coalition, including Canadians. Individuals and terrorist groups in the
            region may be inspired to carry out attacks in a show of solidarity with ISIL. Canadians
            could also be targeted by a terrorist attack and be considered prime kidnapping targets.
            Exercise a high degree of personal security awareness at all times, maintain a
            heightened level of vigilance and be aware of your surroundings at all times.

            There is a significant terrorist threat from domestic and international terrorist groups
            throughout Turkey. There are regular reports by local media of planned attacks against
            such targets as Syrian opposition officials in Ankara, Antakya (Hatay), Gaziantep and
            Istanbul.

            Large- and small-scale bomb attacks have occurred. While Turkish institutions are
            usually the targets, terrorists also target locations frequented by foreigners. On
            February 1, 2013, a suicide attack on the United States embassy in Ankara left two dead.
            On March 1, 2012, a remote-controlled explosive device was detonated near the Justice
            and Development Party building in Istanbul’s Sutluce district, injuring 15 police
            officers and one civilian.

            Heightened security measures are in place throughout the country. Be aware of your
            surroundings at all times, particularly around security and military installations and
            areas with high pedestrian traffic, including hotels, shopping malls and open air
            bazaars. Exercise caution in commercial establishments, public places and other areas
            where large numbers of people, particularly foreigners, may congregate.
            Kidnapping

            There is a threat of kidnapping along the borders with Syria and Iraq, where Muslim
            extremist groups take advantage of porous borders and an unpredictable security
            situation to carry out operations. Groups such as ISIL and Jabat Al Nusra, who use
            kidnapping as a means of raising funds, may target the local population, foreigners and
            even foreign aid workers for kidnapping for ransom.
            Demonstrations

            Avoid all demonstrations, particularly those in Taksim Square in Istanbul, as even
            peaceful gatherings may lead to violent incidents and clashes with security forces,
            which have used water cannons and tear gas to disperse crowds. Follow the advice of
            local authorities and monitor local and international media.

            There is a higher risk of clashes between protesters and police on days of national
            significance, particularly on May Day, held annually on May 1.
            Crime

            Petty crime, including pickpocketing and purse snatching, occurs, particularly in
            Istanbul. Avoid showing signs of affluence and ensure that personal belongings and
            passports and other travel documents are secure at all times.

            Muggings, assaults and sexual assaults occur. Drugs may be administered through drinks,
            food, chewing gum or other means, and drugged victims are usually robbed. Do not accept
            food and drinks from strangers, even if the wrapping or container appears intact.

            Do not frequent down-market bars and neighbourhoods. One scam, particularly common in
            Istanbul, involves locals inviting tourists to bars for food and drinks and then forcing
            them to pay a steep bill.

            Do not accept letters, parcels or other items from strangers. Drug traffickers sometimes
            attempt to convince foreigners to deliver packages and messages into and out of Turkey.
            Women’s safety

            Women may experience physical and verbal harassment. There is a greater risk of sexual
            assault during the summer holiday period in coastal resort areas. See Her Own Way: A
            Woman’s Safe-Travel Guide for travel safety information for Canadian women.
            Road travel

            Turkey has a modern road network that is constantly being improved; however, uneven
            surfaces and poorly marked lane changes near construction zones are common. Exercise
            caution, especially when driving in the rain. Severe weather conditions may seriously
            affect road conditions.

            Accidents are common. Reckless driving, perilous road conditions, inadequate lighting,
            poor signage and high traffic congestion pose hazards. Avoid driving after dark.

            If you are involved in an accident with a vehicle, do not move your vehicle, regardless
            of whether or not you are blocking traffic or anyone is injured. Wait until the police
            have made an official report.

            Pedestrians do not have the right of way.

            Consult the General Directorate of Highways for more information on road travel in
            Turkey.
            Rail travel

            Turkey is modernizing its main railroads and has introduced a high-speed corridor
            between Istanbul and Ankara.
            Air travel

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            Mount Ararat

            Mount Ararat, in the eastern province of Igdir, is a special military zone. Mountain
            climbing is permitted only with official permission, and if accompanied by a
            professional guide. There is a threat of kidnapping in this area.
            General safety information

            Leave your passport in a safe place and carry a photocopy for identification purposes,
            as police may erect checkpoints without warning, particularly in southern Turkey.

            There are numerous stray dogs and cats in Istanbul, Ankara and other cities. Dogs often
            travel together in packs and attack pedestrians and joggers.
            Emergency services

            Dial 155 for police (or 154 if you are in a rural area), 112 for an ambulance and 110
            for firefighters.

            Terrorism

            Heightened tensions throughout the region, together with increased threats globally from
            terrorism, may put you at risk. Maintain a high level of caution at all times.
            Crime

            Violent crime is low. However, mugging and pickpocketing do occur. Acts of banditry
            occur in remote areas. Remain vigilant and ensure that your personal belongings,
            passports, and other travel documents are secure. Do not travel alone and avoid showing
            signs of affluence.
            Demonstrations

            Demonstrations occur and have the potential to suddenly turn violent. They can lead to
            significant disruptions to traffic and public transportation. Avoid all demonstrations
            and large gatherings, follow the advice of local authorities and monitor local media.
            Women’s safety

            Women should not travel alone in Turkmenistan. Consult our publication entitled Her Own
            Way: A Woman’s Safe-Travel Guide for travel safety information specifically aimed at
            Canadian women.
            Transportation

            Exercise caution on intercity roads, as driving standards are poor. Rural roads are
            often in disrepair and not lit. Animals frequently wander onto the road. Random traffic
            police checks are routine.

            Do not travel or use public transportation after dark.

            Use only officially marked taxis and pre-negotiate the fare. Avoid shared taxis.

            Avoid travel by train, as service is slow and crime is prevalent. If travel by train is
            necessary, store your personal belongings in a safe place and do not leave the
            compartment unattended. Ensure that your door is secured from the inside.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            Regional travel

            You may encounter difficulties and processing delays in obtaining official permission to
            travel outside Ashgabat. Areas bordering Iran, Uzbekistan and Afghanistan, including the
            city of Dashoguz and areas of the Caspian coast are restricted zones. Travel to these
            areas is forbidden without prior permission from the government of Turkmenistan.
            General safety information

            The Embassy of Canada in Ankara, Turkey, has consular responsibility for Turkmenistan.
            Entry visa policies and procedures restrict Canadian officials\' access to Turkmenistan,
            significantly limiting the ability of the Canadian government to provide prompt consular
            assistance in this country, even in emergencies. Register with the Embassy of Canada in
            Ankara or contact the Emergency Watch and Response Centre at 613-996-8885.

            Police and military officials are prevalent throughout Turkmenistan. Carry a photocopy
            of your passport, the original, or other photo-identification at all times, as officials
            frequently request proof of identity. Leave a photocopy of your passport with a relative
            or a friend at home.

            Foreigners are often subjected to questioning and car and home searches. Some have been
            detained.

            Curfews may be imposed and areas may be cordoned off upon short notice. The violation of
            a curfew can result in immediate deportation and a ban against returning to Turkmenistan
            for five years.

            Tourist facilities are limited, especially outside Ashgabat. Many goods and services are
            not available.
            Emergency services

            Dial 01 for the fire department, 02 for the police and 03 for an ambulance.

            Crime

            Petty crime occurs, including rental car theft. Muggings and armed assaults are also
            reported, mostly in areas popular with tourists. You should be especially vigilant on
            Providenciales, which has a higher crime rate than other islands. You should also
            exercise vigilance when staying at villas in secluded areas, as these may be seen by
            criminals as easy targets for theft. Victims of robbery may suffer injuries if they
            resist. Do not bring valuables, including travel documents and purses, to the beach.
            Avoid deserted beaches or other poorly lit, isolated areas after dark. Exercise normal
            precautions and ensure that your personal belongings, passports and other travel
            documents are secure at all times.

            If you plan to explore remote areas of the islands for bird watching, diving or
            snorkelling, inform friends, relatives or hotel management of the time of your expected
            return.
            Spiked food and drinks

            Never leave food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers. Be wary of accepting
            snacks, beverages, gum, or cigarettes from new acquaintances, as they may contain drugs
            that could put you at risk of sexual assault and robbery.
            Road travel

            Main roads are generally in good condition. Be careful when driving after dark or on
            secondary roads, since unpaved surfaces, potholes and roaming animals may pose risks.

            Taxis are readily available; fares should be determined in advance.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.

            Area bordering the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) (see Advisory)

            The situation remains volatile in the eastern part of neighbouring DRC and could lead to
            possible incursions into western Uganda by DRC rebels. Tensions between tribes remain in
            the Western region, and led to attacks against police stations and military barracks in
            July 2014, which resulted in dozens of casualties, including civilians.
            Karamoja region (see Advisory)

            Banditry, lawlessness and potential for inter-ethnic clashes pose a risk in the Karamoja
            region.
            Area bordering South Sudan (see Advisory)

            There are risks associated with banditry and with the influx of refugees fleeing the
            conflict in neighbouring South Sudan.
            Terrorism

            Regional terror groups, including those associated with al Qaeda and al-Shabaab,
            continue to threaten Western interests and other potential targets in Uganda.

            On April 3, 2015, the Uganda Police Force issued a terror alert indicating that
            educational institutions along the Kampala-Jinja highway could be targeted for attacks.
            On March 25, 2015, the U.S. Embassy in Kampala issued a security message providing the
            following information to their nationals: "The U.S Embassy has received information of
            possible terrorist threats to locations where Westerners, including U.S. citizens,
            congregate in Kampala, and that an attack may take place soon. Out of an abundance of
            caution, the U.S. Mission has cancelled some non-essential events scheduled at local
            hotels in the coming days. U.S. citizens staying or visiting hotels should expect
            increased security sweeps and delays when entering or exiting hotel areas.”

            The September 21, 2013, attack on an upscale Nairobi mall illustrates the threat of
            attacks on civilians in East Africa. In recent years, attacks, some resulting in large
            numbers of casualties, have been carried out in areas popular among tourists and
            expatriates in Uganda. Although no major attack has occurred recently, further attacks
            of a similar nature cannot be ruled out.
            Crime

            Armed banditry, car thefts and muggings occur throughout the country. Cases of armed
            robbery against pedestrians have been reported, even during day time. Petty crime,
            including pickpocketing, purse and jewellery snatching, and theft from hotel rooms and
            vehicles, is common. Keep your vehicle doors locked at all times, windows closed and
            personal belongings, including handbags, safely stored. Items such as laptops and
            briefcases should not be left in unattended vehicles. Remain vigilant when using public
            transportation or walking along deserted streets. Avoid walking at night.

            There has been an increase in reports of taxi/matatu (minibus) operators robbing their
            passengers and stranding them far from their destination. Avoid taxis/matatus that have
            only one or two passengers and ensure that all your personal belongings are secure at
            all times when using public transportation.
            Demonstrations

            Demonstrations occur regularly, in many parts of the country, and have led to violence
            in the past. Avoid all gatherings and demonstrations, as they may turn violent without
            warning. Monitor local news reports and follow the advice of local authorities.
            Road travel

            Traffic drives on the left. A lack of traffic signs, local driving habits, wandering
            animals, pedestrians and poor road conditions pose risks. Pedestrians should exercise
            caution when crossing roads. There are many fatal road accidents in Uganda. The
            Jinja–Kampala and Kampala–Masaka roads are of particular concern. Alcohol is often a
            contributing factor to accidents, particularly at night. Highway travel is dangerous,
            especially after dark, because of banditry and poor road conditions. Avoid driving
            outside major cities after dark.

            In the event of an accident, Ugandan law requires drivers to stop and exchange
            information and assistance. There is a possibility of mob anger if the accident has
            caused serious injury. In such cases, you are advised to remain in your vehicle and
            drive to the nearest police station to report the accident.

            If travelling to Uganda by road, you should get information at border police stations
            regarding the security situation at the destinations you intend to visit.
            Public transportation

            Avoid intercity buses (especially overnight long-distance buses) and vans. Fatal
            accidents caused by reckless driving, excessive speed and poor vehicle maintenance have
            occurred in the past.

            Exercise caution when using other forms of public transportation such as matatus and
            boda-bodas (scooter taxis) and ensure that the vehicle is in good condition before
            departure. If you opt to travel by boda-boda, wear a helmet at all times.

            Ferry accidents are not uncommon, due to overloading and poor maintenance of some
            vessels. Do not board vessels that appear overloaded or unseaworthy.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            Game parks and reserves

            You are advised to contact the Uganda Wildlife Authority before visiting any park or
            wildlife reserve. Visits to game parks and reserves should be undertaken only with a
            reputable tour company.
            Fraud

            Fraud involving credit cards, traveller’s cheques and wire transfers is common in
            Uganda. Exercise caution when using automated banking machines (ABMs) and protect your
            personal banking information. Business fraud also occurs frequently. These scams range
            from attempts to engage business people in fictitious money transfer schemes, to
            fraudulent solicitations to supply goods in fulfillment of non-existent Ugandan
            government contracts. Any unsolicited business proposal, particularly land transactions,
            should be carefully scrutinized before funds are committed, goods or services are
            provided or travel is undertaken. See Overseas Fraud for more information.
            General safety information

            Don’t show signs of affluence. Don’t venture out alone after dark in dimly lit
            backstreets. Travelling in groups is recommended at any time.

            Carry a photocopy of your passport’s identification page and the page containing your
            visa, and keep the original in a secure place.

            Do not accept food or drinks from strangers, even children, as it may be drugged. If
            attacked, do not resist, as offering resistance may result in violence.

            Women should be particularly cautious when travelling alone in Uganda. See Her Own Way:
            A Woman’s Safe-Travel Guide for more information.

            Tourist facilities and infrastructure are adequate in Kampala but limited elsewhere in
            the country.

            In the event of an emergency, call 999.

            Crimea

            Armed groups supported by Russian military forces took control of a variety of
            government buildings, airports, military installations, and other locations in the
            Crimean Peninsula in February 2014.

            Russia announced its illegal annexation of Crimea on March 18, 2014. Canada does not
            recognize this act and continues to consider Crimea to be sovereign Ukrainian Territory.
            The Canadian Embassy in Moscow is only accredited to Russia and therefore cannot provide
            services in Crimea, while the Embassy in Kyiv has limited access to consular clients.
            Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts

            Armed operations continue to take place in the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts and have
            resulted in injuries and fatalities. A state of emergency was declared in Donetsk and
            Luhansk Oblasts on January 26, 2015. If you are in the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts,
            remain indoors, maintain a low profile and only consider travelling if it is safe to do
            so. Remain vigilant, avoid all demonstrations and large gatherings, follow the advice of
            local authorities and monitor local media.

            The security situation deteriorated significantly in Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts in late
            April 2014. Government buildings, and transportation hubs and services have been
            impacted. Contact train stations to check the status of your trip prior to travelling,
            as they may close without warning.
            Kharkiv Oblast

            Low intensity explosive devices have been set in facilities associated with the
            Ukrainian military and its volunteer supporters, including in areas adjacent to popular
            tourist sites and commercial centres. Government buildings and services may be impacted.
            Airports may close on short notice. Contact your airline to check the status of your
            flight prior to travelling to the airport. Avoid all demonstrations and large
            gatherings, follow the advice of local authorities and monitor local media.
            Demonstrations

            While the situation has stabilized and parliamentary elections took place in October
            2014, demonstrations and marches could recommence with little notice. The situation in
            Kyiv has calmed significantly. Businesses and schools in Kyiv are open and the public
            transportation system has resumed normal service. Exercise a high degree of caution,
            avoid all demonstrations and large gatherings, follow the advice of local authorities
            and monitor local media.
            Crime

            Street crime (pickpocketing and scamming) is common, particularly in crowded places, in
            tourist areas, in bars and nightclubs and on public transportation. There has been a
            slight increase in street crime in Central Kyiv, especially after nightfall. This
            includes muggings. Pickpocketing on the Kyiv metro has also increased.

            Armed robbery can also occur, especially in the larger cities. Racially motivated
            violence and harassment can occur without corrective action by local authorities.

            Ensure that your personal belongings, passports and other travel documents are secure at
            all times. Avoid showing signs of affluence and carrying large sums of cash.
            Fraud and scams

            Debit and credit card fraud occurs. Pay careful attention when your cards are being
            handled by others during payment processing. The use of on-street automated banking
            machines (ABMs) is not recommended.

            One common scam involves a person dropping a wallet or a bundle of money in front of a
            tourist, hoping the tourist will pick it up. The scam artist then accuses the tourist of
            stealing some of the money. These scams can involve several crooks, some posing as
            police officers. Should this happen to you, do not pick up the dropped items; simply
            walk away without engaging in conversation.

            Be aware of potential Internet fraud by persons claiming to live in Ukraine who offer
            goods for sale or profess companionship, romantic interest or marriage proposals.
            Neither the Embassy of Canada nor Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development Canada is in a
            position to help recover lost funds or property in such cases.

            See our Overseas Fraud page for more information on scams abroad.
            Spiked food and drinks

            Never leave food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers. Be wary of accepting
            snacks, beverages, gum or cigarettes from new acquaintances, as they may contain drugs
            that could put you at risk of sexual assault and robbery.
            Road travel

            Travel by road can be hazardous. Most roads outside major cities are poorly maintained.
            Drivers are often aggressive and have little regard for traffic regulations. Pedestrians
            should be particularly careful.

            Avoid driving after dark outside major cities, as limited road visibility, poor vehicle
            maintenance and intoxicated drivers pose threats.

            Motorists should not stop or camp overnight in isolated areas.

            While roadside services such as gas stations and repair facilities are increasingly
            common, they remain inadequate.
            Public transportation

            Kyiv has a punctual and reliable metro system. Buses are usually overcrowded and in poor
            condition. Vehicles can be rented at rental agencies in major cities and at some major
            hotels in Kyiv. Only use officially marked taxis and do not share them with strangers.

            Exercise caution on trains, particularly at night, due to the risk of robbery and
            muggings. Store personal belongings and travel documents in a safe place and do not
            leave the compartment unattended. Ensure that the door is secured from the inside. Avoid
            travelling alone.

            The main ports for sea travel are Izmail, on the Danube Delta, and Odessa. Ferry service
            is available to a number of cities on the Black Sea and the Mediterranean.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            General safety information

            Exercise a high degree of caution.. Ensure that your personal belongings, passports and
            other travel documents are secure at all times. Avoid showing signs of affluence and
            carrying large sums of cash.

            Tourist facilities outside the major centres of Kyiv, Lviv and Odessa are not highly
            developed. Mobile phone coverage is available across the country, though gaps exist in
            lightly populated rural areas.
            Emergency services

            Dial 101 to reach firefighters, 102 for police and 103 for an ambulance.

            Terrorism

            On September 21, 2014, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) released a
            statement threatening retaliation for the American-led coalition campaign against ISIL
            in Iraq and Syria. The statement encouraged opportunistic and indiscriminate attacks
            against citizens and interests of countries supporting the coalition, including
            Canadians. Individuals and terrorist groups in the region may be inspired to carry out
            attacks in a show of solidarity with ISIL. Canadians could also be targeted by a
            terrorist attack and be considered kidnapping targets. Exercise a high degree of
            personal security awareness at all times, maintain a heightened level of vigilance and
            be aware of your surroundings at all times.

            The terrorist threat is considerably lower in the United Arab Emirates (U.A.E.) than in
            the rest of the Arabian Peninsula. Heightened security measures are currently in place
            and may be reinforced upon short notice across the peninsula, where reports of planned
            terrorist attacks occasionally emerge. Maintain a high level of vigilance and personal
            security awareness at all times. Exercise caution in areas known to be frequented by
            foreigners (commercial and tourist areas), monitor local developments and follow the
            advice of local authorities.
            Demonstrations

            Demonstrations, which must first be authorized by the government, rarely occur, and have
            focused mainly on regional political developments. Avoid all demonstrations and large
            gatherings, follow the advice of local authorities and monitor local media.
            Crime

            The crime rate is low and violence is rare. Petty crime, such as purse snatching and
            pickpocketing, occurs. Lock car doors at all times. Ensure that your personal belongings
            and passports and other travel documents are secure at all times. Do not agree to carry
            anyone else’s packages, especially across borders.
            Women’s safety

            Although it is rare, women have been verbally harassed and physically assaulted. Women
            should travel in groups and avoid travelling alone at night. Consult our publication
            entitled Her Own Way: A Woman’s Safe-Travel Guide for travel safety information for
            Canadian women.
            Road travel

            Accidents commonly occur. Driving habits differ markedly from those practised in Canada.
            Drifting sands and roaming animals may create hazards.

            Do not drive off-road unless you are in a convoy of four-wheel-drive vehicles and with
            an experienced guide only. Leave your travel itinerary with a third party. Ensure you
            are well prepared with a sufficient supply of gasoline, water and food, and a cell
            phone.

            Use only officially marked taxis with meters. Avoid shared or service taxis.
            Sea travel

            Pirate attacks occur in coastal waters and, in some cases, farther out at sea. Mariners
            should take appropriate precautions. For additional information, consult the Live Piracy
            Report published by the International Chamber of Commerce.

            Exercise caution if travelling by sea, including for recreational purposes, in the
            Persian Gulf, particularly around the islands of Abu Masa and the Tunbs. Iran and the
            United Arab Emirates each claim sovereignty over the islands.
            Air travel

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.

            Northern Ireland

            The implementation of the 1998 Good Friday Agreement saw a marked reduction in sectarian
            violence in Northern Ireland. Although the main paramilitary groups are observing a
            ceasefire, some small renegade groups, on both sides, have not accepted the agreement
            and continue to be responsible for acts of violence, including car bombs. Authorities
            may occasionally impose localized measures, such as traffic or parcel/luggage checks, in
            the interest of public safety.

            Civil unrest, often associated with Protestant parades through predominantly Catholic
            neighbourhoods, may occur in Northern Ireland during the Orange Order summer marching
            season (April to August). Violent rioting took place in East Belfast from June 20 to 23,
            2011. Exercise caution during the summer marching season and follow the advice of local
            authorities.

            Expect possible delays and disruptions in some areas during the weeks leading up to July
            12, the day Protestants celebrate their victory at the Battle of the Boyne.
            Crime

            Petty crime (pickpocketing, purse snatching and mugging) occurs at tourist sites and
            airports, in tourist areas, restaurants, pubs and bars, as well as on public
            transportation. Be vigilant, particularly in urban areas during the summer months.
            Vehicle theft also occurs.
            Terrorism

            There is a fluctuating threat of terrorist attacks in the United Kingdom. Exercise
            caution and maintain a high level of personal security awareness at all times and in all
            places. Monitor local media for the latest information on threats to security. Visit the
            United Kingdom Home Office website for more information on threat levels.
            Demonstrations

            Demonstrations occur and have the potential to suddenly turn violent. They can lead to
            significant disruptions to traffic and public transportation. Avoid all demonstrations
            and large gatherings, follow the advice of local authorities and monitor local media.

            Since fall 2010, activists have staged a series of violent demonstrations in London and
            other cities to protest against government cutbacks. Further clashes cannot be ruled
            out.
            Road travel

            Roads are excellent but are often narrow and congested, especially in urban areas.

            Traffic drives on the left. Use caution when entering a traffic circle (roundabout).
            Pedestrians should use caution when crossing streets.
            Public transportation

            Public transportation is excellent and extensive.

            Sexual assaults and robberies have been reported by passengers using unlicensed taxis.
            Use only officially marked taxis. Consult the Transport for London website for more
            information.

            Ferry services link the United Kingdom to Europe and Ireland. The Eurotunnel spans the
            English Channel from England to France.

            Delays may occur on train routes, including Eurostar trains, due to track repairs or
            flooding. Expect delays also at airports and other ports of entry due to stringent
            security screening measures.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            Spiked food and drinks

            Never leave food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers. Be wary of accepting
            snacks, beverages, gum, or cigarettes from new acquaintances, as they may contain drugs
            that could put you at risk of sexual assault and robbery.
            Fraud

            Credit card and automated banking machine (ABM) card fraud is increasing, as well as
            identity theft. Beware of ABM scams; they can range from simple to sophisticated,
            sometimes involving hidden electronic devices that obtain account information and
            personal identification numbers (PINs). Pay careful attention when cards are being
            handled by others during payment processing.

            There is also a marked increase in financial scams conducted over the Internet, whereby
            con artists try to convince victims to send them money. Scenarios involve lotteries,
            online dating, inheritance notices, and email hacking giving the appearance that a
            friend is in trouble and requires funds to be wired.

            In addition, Canadian citizens regularly receive requests for emergency funding from
            persons whom they have “met” online. The scammer builds up a relationship and gains a
            person’s trust, before declaring that they need funds to deal with a fabricated
            emergency, such as the need for hospital treatment.

            See our Overseas Fraud page for more information on scams abroad.
            General safety information

            Remain vigilant in all places and avoid isolated areas. Ensure that your personal
            belongings, passports and other travel documents are secure at all times. Avoid showing
            signs of affluence and carrying large sums of cash.

            Crime

            The possession of firearms and the frequency of violent crime are generally more
            prevalent than in Canada. Within large metropolitan areas, violent crime more commonly
            occurs in economically disadvantaged neighbourhoods, particularly from dusk to dawn.
            Verify official neighbourhood crime statistics before planning an outing.

            Robbery and assault can also occur in wealthy residential or commercial districts.
            Exercise caution, particularly at night. Violent crimes, particularly assault, are often
            connected to alcohol and drug consumption. Remain alert and discreet while in
            entertainment areas.

            Canadians have been the victims of crime such as break-ins, assaults and pickpocketing
            in the Miami area, sometimes during daylight hours. Theft occurs in the North Miami
            Beach area, at South Beach and at airports, particularly from trunks of parked cars. Be
            alert, as criminals use a variety of techniques to steal personal belongings.

            Passport theft is on the rise. Ensure that your travel documents are secure at all
            times.
            Terrorism

            The Department of Homeland Security maintains a public alert system on terrorism. Visit
            the website of the National Terrorism Advisory System for more information. Continue to
            exercise normal security precautions.
            Driving to Mexico

            Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development Canada currently advises against non-essential
            travel to the Mexican side of the border region with the U.S., and does not recommend
            crossing the U.S.-Mexico border by car, due to continuously high levels of violence
            linked to organized crime in those areas. For more information on travel to Mexico,

            Crime

            Street crimes such as pickpocketing, armed robbery and muggings are on the rise in
            Montevideo, particularly in Plaza Independencia, the port area, La Ciudad Vieja (the Old
            City) and Avenida 18 de Julio. Avoid the "Cerro" neighbourhood and be cautious when
            walking downtown, including in well-travelled areas.

            During the summer (Canadian winter), tourist police patrol the following Montevideo
            neighbourhoods, where most hotels are located: Pocitos, Punta Carretas, El Centro, La
            Ciudad Vieja, El Cordón and El Parque Rodo. Uruguayan law enforcement authorities have
            increased the number of uniformed police officers on foot in areas where criminal
            activity is concentrated, as well as the number of patrol cars in residential areas. The
            clearly marked patrol cars are equipped with cellular phones, and the phone numbers are
            painted on the vehicles.

            Petty crime also occurs in towns bordering Brazil. Do not display large amounts of money
            in public. Ensure that your personal belongings and travel documents are secure at all
            times.
            Demonstrations

            Demonstrations occur regularly in Montevideo. Avoid all demonstrations and public
            gatherings and do not attempt to cross roadblocks, even if these appear unattended. You
            should also refrain from approaching any demonstrations with cameras and communications
            devices.

            Before travelling by road from Uruguay to Argentina, monitor local news reports to
            confirm that there are no scheduled blockades or demonstrations on the bridges
            connecting the two countries. Local transportation services are occasionally disrupted.
            Road travel

            Exercise caution and common sense when travelling by motor vehicle. The accident rate is
            high. Roads are often winding, the terrain is hilly, and most intersections do not have
            stop signs or traffic lights. Many cars are poorly maintained, and traffic regulations
            are routinely ignored. It is advisable to buy gas near urban centres because the next
            station may be a long distance away. The main toll road to Punta del Este is good and
            well marked. The use of cellular phones while driving is prohibited.

            You should exercise caution when choosing taxis in Montevideo. When possible, select one
            with three-point seat belts in the back seats or insist on sitting in front along with
            the driver. Taxis are equipped with a thick glass partition installed to protect drivers
            against crime. About three injuries a day are reported as people are thrown against the
            partition when the driver brakes suddenly or is involved in an accident. Injuries can be
            severe even in minor collisions.

            Emergency services

            The emergency number in Montevideo for police, fire and medical assistance is 911. In
            the rest of the country, dial 02-911 to connect with the Montevideo central emergency
            authority, which will then contact the local emergency service.

            Areas bordering Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and the Kyrgyz Republic (see Advisory)

            Incidents of violence have occurred in the mountainous border area where the Kyrgyz
            Republic, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan meet.

            Some areas near the Tajikistan border are mined. Contact the Consulate of Canada in
            Tashkent for more information.

            The border between Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan on the road between Tashkent and Samarkand
            is closed. Contact the Consulate of Canada in Tashkent for up-to-date information prior
            to travelling to the Tajikistan border.
            Terrorism

            Heightened tensions throughout the region, together with increased threats globally from
            terrorism, may put you at risk. Maintain a high level of vigilance at all times.
            Exercise caution, particularly in tourist areas, in commercial and public establishments
            (hotels, clubs, restaurants, bars, schools, places of worship) and at outdoor recreation
            events.
            Crime

            Violent crime against foreigners has occurred. Street crime has increased, especially
            after dark in urban centres.

            Foreigners have been robbed by individuals posing as police officers. If approached, ask
            to see police credentials or offer to go to the police station.

            Do not travel alone after dark and do not show signs of affluence.
            Transportation

            Driving standards in Uzbekistan are poor. Many roads outside Tashkent are in poor
            condition, particularly in the Tian Shan and Fan Mountains. Driving at night is
            dangerous. Rural roads and highways are not lit.

            Use officially marked taxis only and do not share taxis with strangers.

            Exercise caution when travelling by train, especially overnight. Store valuables in a
            safe place and do not leave the compartment unattended. Ensure that the door is secured
            from the inside.

            When travelling by rail or road in Uzbekistan, it is sometimes necessary to cross into
            neighbouring countries. Consult the Entry/Exit Requirements tab for more information.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            General safety information

            Police frequently stop drivers for minor infractions or simple document checks.
            Foreigners may face harassment, including demands for money.

            Carry identification at all times. Carry a photocopy of your passport and to leave
            another one with a relative or a friend at home.

            Ensure that personal belongings, passports and other travel documents are secure at all
            times.

            Tourist facilities are limited.
            Emergency services

            Dial 01 for firefighters, 02 for police or 03 for an ambulance.

            Crime

            Violent crime in Vanuatu is low, but petty crime is prevalent. Ensure that your personal
            belongings, passports and other travel documents are secure at all times.

            Do not visit beaches or other isolated areas alone. This is particularly important for
            women. Consult our publication entitled Her Own Way: A Woman’s Safe-Travel Guide for
            travel safety information specifically aimed at Canadian women.
            Demonstrations

            Public disturbances occur on occasion. Avoid demonstrations and closely monitor local
            developments.
            Transportation

            The islands of Efate and Santo have paved roads. Roads in all other areas are unpaved or
            dirt tracks. The speed limit is 50 kilometres per hour.

            Taxis may be hailed on the street and are metered. Minibuses are also available.

            Most inter-island travel is by air or sea. Boat services between Vanuatu’s islands are
            often unreliable, and seaworthiness cannot be assured. Do not board vessels that appear
            overloaded or unseaworthy.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            General safety information

            You are encouraged to register with the High Commission of Australia in Port Vila in
            order to receive the latest information on situations and events that could affect your
            safety.

            Tourist facilities and services are good but limited outside Port-Vila.

            Sharks are present in the waters off Vanuatu, particularly around the islands of
            Espiritu Santo and Malekula. Seek advice from local authorities before swimming.

            Colombian border (see Advisory)

            Colombian guerrillas, who frequently operate on both sides of the border, are suspected
            in several kidnapping cases. Foreigners have been specifically targeted near the border
            with Colombia. Cross-border violence, kidnapping, smuggling and drug trafficking occur
            frequently in remote areas, specifically in the states of Zulia, Táchira, Barinas,
            Bolívar, Apure, Amazonas, Anzoátegui and Sucre.
            Demonstrations and political activities

            Demonstrations occur regularly throughout Venezuela, particularly in the cities of
            Caracas, Barquisimeto, Maracaibo, Merida, Valencia, San Cristobal and Maracay. Violent
            clashes regularly take place at these demonstrations, especially at night, and have
            resulted in deaths and numerous injuries. Avoid all demonstrations, large gatherings and
            public areas where disturbances or violent incidents could occur, follow the advice of
            local authorities and monitor local developments. Do not participate in political
            discussions or activities in public, or appear to take sides on any local issue related
            to the current political situation, as doing so could lead to arrest or even
            deportation.

            Demonstrations often cause traffic jams in Caracas, especially in the historic centre of
            Plaza Bolívar (where most government institutions are located), in Plaza Venezuela, in
            Plaza Francia (Altamira), as well as in major centres throughout the country and on main
            highways. Do not attempt to cross blockades, even if they appear unattended. During
            major events, such as large demonstrations, network overload could interrupt local
            cellular and landline phone services. Other services could also be interrupted. Curfews
            may be imposed by authorities at any time and should be respected.
            Crime

            Venezuela has one of the world’s highest homicide rates. Violent crime, including murder
            and armed robbery, is prevalent throughout the country, including in national parks and
            tourist areas. The airport and the surrounding areas have seen an increase in violent
            crime recently. Violence against foreigners can occur in all regions, both urban and
            rural.

            Petty crime is common, particularly in the central and poorer areas of all major cities
            and on Margarita Island. You should exercise caution in the areas of Sabana Grande and
            Plaza Venezuela in central Caracas, due to an increase in violent robberies. Pickpockets
            are active in crowded bus and subway stations. Ensure that your personal belongings and
            travel documents are secure, including on beaches, in parked vehicles and in hotel
            rooms. Do not show signs of affluence or display valuables. Thefts from hotel safes have
            been reported. Use automated banking machines (ABMs) during the day only, choose ABMs in
            shopping malls or busy residential areas, and stay alert to your surroundings.

            Incidents of carjacking and kidnapping have increased. Victims are usually forced out of
            their vehicles at gunpoint or knifepoint and robbed of their money, jewellery and
            identification. Others have been forced into cars at gunpoint and driven out of the
            city. They may also be forced to withdraw funds at ABMs and, in some cases, held captive
            until their families pay a ransom. Victims have been injured, or even killed, for
            failing to cooperate. While foreigners are not specifically targeted, you should avoid
            walking or driving in isolated areas, particularly after dark.

            Exercise caution in dealing with strangers or recent acquaintances, and be especially
            careful about accepting rides or invitations. Incidents of drugging followed by robbery
            and assault, including sexual assault, have been reported.

            Acquaintance rape is a serious problem. In some cases, hotel workers and taxi drivers
            have been implicated. Anyone who is a victim of a sexual assault should report it
            immediately to the nearest Canadian consulate or embassy and is strongly advised to file
            a report with Venezuelan authorities. Note that no criminal investigation is possible
            without a formal complaint to Venezuelan authorities.

            Criminals posing as police officers have harassed and extorted money from tourists.
            There have also been reports of Venezuelan officials at airports, immigration offices
            and police stations imposing excessive charges. If you experience a problem, you should
            pay the requested fine, ask for the officer’s name, badge number or patrol car number,
            and report the incident to the Embassy of Canada in Caracas.

            There have been incidents of piracy and armed robbery against ships in coastal areas and
            marinas, some involving a high degree of violence, including murder. Owners of small
            vessels, including private yachts, should be aware of the risk of attack and take
            appropriate precautions. For additional information, consult the Live Piracy Report
            published by the International Maritime Bureau.

            In some areas of Caracas and elsewhere in the country, police presence and response are
            relatively poor.
            Food shortages

            Shortages of basic food items and necessities have led to long line-ups at grocery
            stores across the country. There have been reports of fighting and theft occurring in
            line-ups. Exercise caution at supermarkets and maintain a stock of non-perishable food
            items and water at your hotel/residence.
            Air transportation

            Airlines have reduced the number of flights arriving and departing from Venezuela;
            therefore, flights may be difficult to book and more expensive than normal. You should
            plan your travel well in advance of your expected departure and contact your travel
            provider for assistance.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            Road travel

            Traffic congestion is common in Caracas. Traffic laws are rarely observed due to the
            lack of police enforcement. You should keep vehicle doors locked and windows closed at
            all times. Night driving is not recommended due to security concerns, unmarked road
            damage or construction, and wandering livestock. Stopping at Bolivarian National Guard
            and police checkpoints is mandatory. Follow all instructions and have vehicle and
            insurance papers and passports readily available. Vehicles may be searched. There have
            been incidents of illegal roadblocks set up by armed bandits who stop and rob vehicles.

            There have been incidents of stone throwing from highway overpasses and bridges near
            poorer neighbourhoods. Motorists are then robbed after stopping to assess the damage to
            their vehicle.

            If an accident occurs, vehicles must not be moved until a traffic police officer fills
            out a report.
            Public transportation

            The road between Caracas and the Simón Bolívar International Airport in Maiquetía is
            dangerous, and crime increases after dark. Plans for travel to and from all airports
            should be arranged in advance. Criminals are known to pose as taxi operators. Licensed,
            radio-dispatched taxis can be organized in advance by hotels or called from the airport.
            Follow the advice of local authorities regarding transportation and allow sufficient
            time to reach the airport.

            You should only use licensed taxis in all areas of Venezuela. These taxis are generally
            safer than unlicensed taxis, although incidents of robbery and assault, often at
            gunpoint, have been reported for both licensed and unlicensed taxis. Never accept
            unsolicited offers of transportation or offers of help with luggage or passenger
            check-in.

            Local buses and the subway in Caracas are not recommended due to the possibility of
            robbery. Incidents have also occurred on intercity buses.
        </item>
        <item>
            Crime

            Petty crime against tourists is increasing, particularly in the larger cities. Although
            violent crimes such as armed robbery are still relatively rare in Vietnam, perpetrators
            have grown increasingly bold. Knives and razors have been used in attempted robberies in
            Ho Chi Minh City. Motorcyclists grab bags and other valuables from pedestrians and from
            passengers or drivers on motorbikes; this often results in injury to the victim. Hotels
            and tourist areas are more likely to be targeted by criminals. Thefts also occur on
            crowded buses and trains and in shopping centres and markets. Bag slashing is a frequent
            occurrence in crowded streets and markets. Avoid showing signs of affluence and ensure
            that your personal belongings and passports and other travel documents are secure at all
            times.

            When leaving the airport, you should only use authorized airport taxis or hotel
            transportation. Authorized taxi companies usually have operators posted at airports who
            are responsible for monitoring taxi services. These companies publish the taxi driver’s
            name and vehicle number on a card that should be affixed to the windshield (in front of
            the driver’s seat). Individuals posing as taxi drivers have targeted foreign visitors at
            Hanoi airport and robbed them by forcing them to withdraw money from automatic banking
            machines. Travellers have also been robbed by drivers who greeted them upon arrival with
            a placard showing their name. If you are expecting to be picked up, ask for your
            driver’s name, phone number and licence plate number before you travel. Be familiar with
            your hotel’s address and neighbouring landmarks because taxi drivers have taken unaware
            visitors to the wrong establishment, in order to receive a commission. Never share a
            taxi with a stranger.

            Threats of physical injury related to personal disputes occasionally occur. If you are
            in this position, contact the local police and the closest Canadian government office
            immediately.
            Credit card fraud

            Both tourists and expatriates have been targeted by credit card forgery crime. Avoid
            using your credit card in smaller establishments, and pay careful attention when others
            are handling your card. Consider obtaining a second card, with a low credit limit, for
            use during your stay in Asia.
            Scams

            Tourists have been victims of gambling scams in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City (particularly
            in the Pham Ngu Lao neighbourhood). This scam usually starts with a friendly invitation
            to someone’s home to meet a relative interested in visiting or studying in Canada. While
            the visitor is waiting for this individual, a casual game of cards will begin. Even
            though they started with only a small wager, victims have reported losing thousands of
            dollars over the course of an evening.
            Demonstrations

            Public demonstrations are generally not tolerated in Vietnam and can carry heavy
            penalties, including lengthy jail sentences. Avoid demonstrations and follow the advice
            of local authorities.
            Transportation

            Traffic accidents occur frequently, often causing death or serious injury. Motorcycle
            riders and pedestrians are common victims. Driving standards are poor, vehicles and
            roads are often badly maintained, and roads in major cities are congested. Rain can
            flood potholes and roads, especially those in the north, can become impassable during
            the rainy season. Travelling after dark is dangerous.

            Driving without a Vietnamese driver’s licence is illegal. If you are involved in a
            traffic accident, you may face criminal charges and have to pay compensation if someone
            is injured. You may be prohibited from leaving the country before paying this
            compensation. Hiring a car and driver for personal transportation is strongly
            recommended. Rent a motorcycle only if you are accustomed to local driving standards and
            be aware that insurance is not included with these rentals. Motorcycle taxis (known as
            “xe oms”) are unsafe and should be avoided.

            Bus accidents are not uncommon. A number of fatal boat accidents have occurred in past
            years, some in Halong Bay. Ensure that your tour operator follows up-to-date safety
            regulations.

            Keep ticket stubs at all times when travelling by train, as they are required when
            exiting the train station. Passengers without a ticket stub will be required to pay the
            fare again.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            Piracy

            Pirate attacks occur in coastal waters and, in some cases, further out at sea. Mariners
            should take appropriate precautions. For additional information, consult the Live Piracy
            and Armed Robbery Report, published by the International Maritime Bureau.
            General safety information

            Travel near military facilities in some parts of the central highlands and in some
            border areas is restricted.

            Unexploded landmines are a hazard in some rural areas of central Vietnam.

            Improper farming and production practices, as well as overall poor hygiene in food
            preparation, make food safety a concern. Exercise a high degree of caution, particularly
            when consuming street food and beverages containing ice cubes. Avoid drinking
            non-bottled water.

            Never leave your food or drink unattended or in the care of strangers. Be wary of
            accepting snacks, beverages, gum or cigarettes from new acquaintances, as they may
            contain drugs that could put you at risk of sexual assault and robbery. Do not purchase
            liquor from street vendors, as the quality cannot be assured.

            Hotel rooms and electronic communications may be monitored. Hotel staff require your
            passport in order to register it with local authorities. The staff may insist on keeping
            your passport until your departure, but there is no legal reason for them to do so. You
            may request the return of your passport once it has been registered.
            Emergency services

            Dial 113 to reach police, 114 for firefighters and 115 for ambulance.

            Security

            The decision to travel is your responsibility. You are also responsible for your
            personal safety abroad. The purpose of this Travel Advice is to provide up-to-date
            information to enable you to make well-informed decisions.

            Canadians rarely encounter security or safety problems, although normal safety
            precautions should be taken. Petty crime occurs. Ensure that your personal belongings
            are secure at all times.

            Ongoing conflict

            Houthi rebels and other armed groups in Yemen, including the Yemeni military, are in
            open conflict throughout the country. A coalition of countries is launching airstrikes
            into Yemen in order to curtail Houthi rebel gains in the country. Airstrikes could occur
            anywhere, at any time.‎

            Although airports may remain operational, most international flights have been
            cancelled. The International Organization for Migration (IOM) may offer seats on flights
            leaving Yemen to Canadians. For more information, please call the IOM’s Cairo-based
            hotline directly at 00 202 02 15 36 128 or 00 201 021 53 61 88. Overland travel is
            extremely dangerous and strongly discouraged; if you are electing any departure option,
            you do so at your own risk.


            Terrorism

            The security situation remains fragile and unpredictable. There is a high terrorist
            threat in Yemen, as terrorists regularly target government buildings. Al Qaida in the
            Arabian Peninsula has targeted Western interests: commercial establishments, diplomatic
            missions and tourist sites could be attacked. Maintain a high level of vigilance and
            personal security awareness at all times. Exercise extreme caution, particularly in
            areas known to be frequented by foreigners (that is, commercial, public and tourist
            areas), monitor local developments and follow the advice of local authorities. Register
            with and carefully follow messages issued through the Registration of Canadians Abroad
            service.

            Terrorist groups also target checkpoints manned by the Houthi rebel group in Sanaa and
            elsewhere in the country, and target Houthis in general.
            Kidnapping

            There is a high risk to foreigners of kidnapping, and some hostages have been killed.
            Maintain a high level of vigilance at all times.
            Demonstrations and civil unrest

            Civil unrest and violent demonstrations occur regularly throughout the country, and
            clashes between security forces and tribal factions have also become commonplace since
            the beginning of May 2012. On January 20, 2015, Houthi rebels clashed with the Yemeni
            military and surrounded the presidential palace in Sanaa. Though the situation
            stabilized shortly thereafter, clashes between armed groups may still occur in the
            capital. On September 21, 2014, fighting between Houthi and government forces caused
            several hundred deaths in Sanaa.

            A state of emergency was declared in March 2011 and remains in effect. The security
            situation deteriorated significantly following a breakdown of negotiations between the
            president and the opposition in May 2011. Avoid all political gatherings, crowds and
            demonstrations, and stay away from areas where they could occur, as they might turn
            violent without warning.
            Landmines

            Anti-personnel mines and unexploded munitions remain a danger in the southern and
            eastern areas of the country, particularly around Aden, and in the central highlands.
            Most have been marked and access clearly delimited. Exercise caution in these areas.
            Crime

            Weapons are easily available throughout the country and tribes are usually heavily
            armed. Petty crime such as credit card scams may occur. Carjacking is a serious concern
            in Yemen. Do not show signs of affluence and ensure that personal belongings and
            passports and other travel documents are secure at all times. Lock car doors and ensure
            that windows are closed.
            Women’s safety

            There have been reports of physical and verbal harassment toward women. Women should
            travel in groups and should not travel alone at night. Women should wear a headscarf,
            cover their arms and legs and avoid making eye contact with men in public.

            Consult our publication entitled Her Own Way: A Woman’s Safe-Travel Guide for travel
            safety information for Canadian women.
            Road travel

            Driving habits differ markedly from those practised in Canada. Avoid driving after dark.
            Poorly maintained vehicles and roads and roaming animals pose hazards.

            Call the police if you are involved in an accident. If the accident results in death or
            injuries, the driver may be jailed and/or fined. Compensation has to be paid to the
            family of the victims.

            Undertake overland travel in a convoy of four-wheel-drive vehicles and with an
            experienced guide only. Leave a travel itinerary with a third party. Do not use the
            Aden-Taiz-Sanaa highway due to the high risk of kidnapping. Be well prepared and
            equipped with gasoline, water, food and a cell phone.

            Avoid renting a car and driving it yourself.

            Avoid public transportation.

            Use only officially marked taxis and negotiate fares in advance.
            Sea travel

            Pirate attacks occur in coastal waters and, in some cases, farther out at sea. Mariners
            should take appropriate precautions. For additional information, consult the Live Piracy
            Report published by the International Maritime Bureau.
            Air travel

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            General safety information

            Maintain emergency provisions such as water and food.

            Do not leave vehicles unattended. If a vehicle is left unattended, carefully inspect
            both the exterior and interior upon return to detect any attached devices or suspect
            packages nearby.

            Treat mail and packages from unfamiliar sources with suspicion.

            Contact your sponsor, employer or Yemeni police immediately if you suspect anything
            unusual.

            Carry identification documents at all times. Leave your passport in a safe place and
            carry a photocopy for identification purposes.

            Checkpoints may be set up without warning.

            Power shortages often occur.
            Emergency services

            Dial 199 in case of emergencies.

            Areas bordering the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Angola and Mozambique (see
            Advisory)

            The possibility of border conflicts and/or the presence of refugees and armed combatants
            make these areas potentially dangerous and unstable. Carjacking and armed assaults also
            pose a risk.

            The risk of landmines is high in Zambia\'s border areas with Angola and Mozambique, and
            you should exercise caution when venturing off the main roads in these areas. If you are
            contemplating overland and cross-border travel, seek advice from local authorities and
            the High Commission of Canada in Lusaka.
            Crime

            Petty crimes such as pickpocketing, purse snatchings, and vehicle break-ins are common,
            particularly in and around bus and railway stations, nightclubs, some shopping areas in
            Lusaka, the Copperbelt towns, other main cities and tourist centres. Ensure personal
            belongings and travel documents are secure at all times.

            Serious crimes occur, such as armed muggings, home invasions and sexual assault. The use
            of date rape drugs at bars and restaurants has been reported in Lusaka. Carjackings are
            a concern, particularly in urban areas, on the roads to and from Lusaka and on the roads
            in the Copperbelt. Remain alert to your surroundings and maintain a high level of
            personal security awareness. If you suspect you are being followed, travel directly to
            the closest police station or public area. Avoid walking alone after dark.

            Car doors should be locked and car windows closed at all times. Police roadblocks are
            common throughout the country and identity documents may be requested.
            Demonstrations

            Demonstrations and strikes are common. Avoid crowds and demonstrations as they can turn
            violent without notice, follow the advice of local authorities and monitor local
            developments.
            Road travel

            Many roads are severely potholed. Traffic accidents occur frequently throughout the
            country, especially on the Great East Road in Lusaka. Pedestrians, poorly lit and
            maintained vehicles, driving habits and stray animals pose risks. Avoid overland travel
            to rural areas after dark.

            Vehicles must be equipped with two metallic emergency triangles, white reflector
            stickers in front and red reflector stickers in back. Failure to comply may result in
            heavy fines.

            As there is no emergency service for stranded drivers, you should carry a cellular phone
            when travelling outside of main cities. However, the use of a cell telephone while
            driving is prohibited.
            Public transportation

            Exercise caution when using public transportation, especially buses, which are often
            overloaded. Taxi fares are expensive and should be paid in local currency. Do not share
            taxis with strangers.

            Rail service is limited.

            An airport tax is charged upon departure from Zambia. The National Airports Corporation
            Limited has added a new security charge to all departing passengers, payable at all NACL
            airports. The cost is US$3 per person for domestic flights and US$5 for international
            flights. Some major airlines incorporate the tax into the ticket price.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            General safety information

            Illegal drug trafficking occurs on a limited scale. Do not accept packages from
            strangers or carry parcels if you are unsure of their contents.

            Wild animals can pose risks. Observe all park or nature reserve regulations and
            instructions given by your tour guides. Avoid swimming in lakes and rivers due to the
            presence of crocodiles.

            Tourist facilities are limited outside well-known game parks. You should ensure that
            valuables, passports and other travel documents are secure at all times and avoid
            showing signs of affluence.

            National congress

            Zimbabwe’s governing political party will be holding a national congress in Harare from
            December 3 to 6, 2014. Avoid large gatherings and demonstrations, follow the advice of
            local authorities, and monitor local media.
            Border with Mozambique

            Do not stray from the main tourist areas near the border with Mozambique, since
            landmines and unexploded munitions still present a danger in this region.

            Avoid large crowds and public gatherings. The situation could deteriorate on short
            notice.
            Crime

            Crime, exacerbated by a very difficult economic situation, remains a serious problem for
            foreign visitors and residents alike.

            Street crime, such as muggings, house robberies, passport theft, carjacking,
            pickpocketing and bag snatching is common. Ensure that your personal belongings and
            travel documents are secure, particularly in crowded places, and carry a photocopy of
            your passport. You should be particularly cautious when leaving banks and automated
            banking machines (ABMs).

            Remain vigilant, avoid travelling alone at all times and avoid walking after dark,
            including in the larger cities such as Harare and Bulawayo, as well as at tourist sites
            such as Victoria Falls, Pungwe Falls, Mterazi Falls, and the Honde Falls.

            Exercise a high degree of caution when travelling to rural areas where violence over
            forced farm redistribution may occur. Central and local authorities in some rural areas
            occasionally respond to outsiders with suspicion and hostility.
            General situation in the country

            Interruptions to the supply of water and electricity are frequent and lengthy in many
            areas, resulting in considerable hardship.

            Food shortages remain a serious problem in rural areas. Keep stores of food, water, fuel
            and emergency supplies on hand in case disruptions were to strand you in your home for a
            few days.
            Road travel

            If you intend to drive to the ocean through Mozambique, be aware that we advise against
            non-essential travel to the Mozambican province of Sofala. Furthermore, we recommend
            that all overland outside of urban centres be avoided due to recent violent incidents.
            Consult the Mozambique Travel Advice page for more information.

            Traffic drives on the left. Roads are not lit so driving after dark is not advised. Due
            to electrical shortages, traffic lights frequently do not work. In this case, the
            traffic does not behave as a four-way stop so pay close attention before proceeding
            through an intersection. Potholes are common and have caused many road accidents. Poorly
            serviced vehicles and dangerous driving habits also contribute to accidents. Cars may
            not have adequate lights at night.

            Pedestrians often walk on the roads, even at night. Domestic and wild animals roam major
            roads, also posing a risk. Avoid driving outside of towns after dark, as cattle and
            broken-down vehicles on the road pose hazards. In the event of a flat tire, drive to a
            service station or residential area before stopping to make repairs, if possible,.

            If you suspect that your vehicle is being followed, drive to the nearest police station.
            Do not leave personal belongings or travel documents unattended in vehicles.

            Drive with your doors locked and windows shut at all times, and park in a guarded
            parking lot overnight.

            Remain vigilant at all times when travelling through the Beitbridge area as highway
            robberies are common, particularly at night.
            Roadblocks

            As roadblocks can be erected anywhere without notice, drive carefully and be very
            cooperative at all times. You could be subject of arbitrary detention or arrest and
            should have your travel documents, such as passport, visas and vehicle police clearance
            certificate with you at all times. You and your vehicle may be searched at any time, as
            well as any person travelling with you. Whatever items are deemed suspicious during a
            search could be seized. You may be asked to pay a fine on the spot or to accompany a
            police officer to the police station. On-the-spot fines are illegal in Zimbabwe and you
            should ask for a ticket to be issued. You can then pay the ticket at the nearest police
            station.
            Public transportation

            Intercity bus and rail travel are dangerous and not recommended. Buses are overcrowded
            and inadequately maintained, and the drivers are often reckless. The rail system is
            underdeveloped and poorly maintained, resulting in numerous accidents. Major hotels
            usually have their own taxis, which can be used safely for intra-city travel. As well,
            taxis recommended by hotels are normally reliable and in good condition. Taxi service is
            only available within major cities and taxis will normally not take you more than 20 km
            outside the city limits.

            See Transportation Safety in order to verify if national airlines meet safety standards.
            Safaris and organized tours

            There are inherent risks to viewing wildlife (both marine and terrestrial), particularly
            on foot or at close range. Always maintain a safe distance when observing wildlife and
            avoid exiting the vehicle unless professional guides or wardens say it is safe to do so.
            Only use reputable and professional guides or tour operators and closely follow park
            regulations and wardens’ advice.
            Fraud

            There have been fraud attempts through email originating from Zimbabwe. Any unsolicited
            business proposal should be carefully scrutinized. See our Overseas Fraud page for more
            information on scams abroad.
